# Docker Build and Push Script
# This script automates the process of building Docker images from Dockerfiles located in specified directories
# and pushing them to a Docker registry. It first checks if the user is logged into the Docker registry and
# prompts for login if necessary. Then, it iterates over specified directories, builds Docker images from
# Dockerfiles found at the root of those directories, and pushes the images to the registry.

# Prerequisites:
# - Docker must be installed and running on your system.
# - You must have access to the Docker registry where images will be pushed.
# - This script assumes Dockerfiles are located directly within the specified directories and not in subdirectories.

# Usage:
# 1. Ensure the script is executable: chmod +x docker-build.sh
# 2. Run the script: ./docker-build.sh

# Configuration:
# - base_name: Set this variable to your Docker registry username or organization name.
# - root_dirs: List the root directories where Dockerfiles are located. Separate each directory with a space.

# Note:
# - The script uses 'docker login' for authentication. Ensure you have access rights to the registry and the
#   specified repositories.
# - The script exits with an error if any step fails, including Docker build or push failures.
