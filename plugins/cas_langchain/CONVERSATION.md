GPT:	Good morning, James. How can I help?

USER: 	What can you do?

GPT:	I’m an AI engine focused on supporting Discovery and Investigation for CAS Mapping.  My core functions are:
Ingest new data via URL
Ingest new data via upload
Summarize or evaluate sources
Answer questions about ingested sources for a particular investigation
Evaluate knowledge gaps in the data.
Search the CAS Discovery Confluence for particular investigations, problem prompts, and opportunity concept reports (OCRs)
Search some trusted external data sources
Generate futurist scenarios based on my data

	Would you like a summary or a list of relevant elements?

USER:	Yes, a summary

GPT:	Okay.
The blah blah blah blah

USER:	Does it mention anything about X?

GPT:	Yes, the yadda yadda yadda yadda.

USER: 	Tell me more about Y?

GPT:	The article does not contain information about Y.  Would you like me to search my other data sources?

USER: 	Yes.

GPT:	Here’s an answer from a different source.
	Y is yadda yadda yadda.

USER: 	What other data is missing for this investigation?

GPT:	Okay.
	There are 10 categories of G data and 52 sub-categories.  Here are the ones with the least source information

	CATEGORY 1 - 4 sources, 2% of total data
	CATEGORY 2 - 5 sources, 2.3% of total data
	SUBCATEGORY 1.1 - 0 sources, 0% of total data
	SUBCATEGORY 5.1 - 1 source, 0.25% of total data

	Would you like to see the bias gaps as well?

USER: 	Yes 

GPT:	CATEGORY 5 - 2 sources are positive on the topic, 0 are negative
	CATEGORY 7 - 10 sources are positive on the topic, 2 are neutral, 1 is negative

	What else can I do for you?

USER: 	Can you list all of the categories?

GPT:	For investigation “G”, there are 10 Categories:
	CATEGORY 1 - 
	CATEGORY 2
	CATEGORY 3
	…
	CATEGORY 10

	What else can I do for you?

USER: 	Search outside your data for news about ABC.

GPT:	Here are 3 of the most relevant news articles about ABC over the last 2 years.  They may or may not exist in my data store yet.  
	
	TITLE, link
	TITLE, link
	TITLE, link

	What else can I do for you?

USER:	I need a scenario.

GPT:	Of course. About what?  It helps to specify a combination of emerging technology, need, or capabilities, the general context of this future (security vs openness, scarcity vs abundance), and the randomness of the answer you want (0 = straightforward, 10 = lots of absurdity).

USER:	Help me imagine the impact of X on Y in 50 years in a society that is focused on security and scarcity.  Use high randomness, like an 8.

GPT:	Here’s one scenario… blah blah blah
	Here are images generated about that scenario.
