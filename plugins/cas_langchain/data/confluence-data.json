In the context of aviation, this refers to moving the aviation ecosystem to a participatory processes. Democracy allows for feedback and input directly from its constituents (communities, cities). Democratization in aviation implies that the design, development and deployment of flying machines are influenced by and benefit all. There may be unintended consequences to democratization such as are being seen with social media, the diminishing role of experts, growth of misinformation, investment bubbles. Population growth is far outpaced by technology growth as shown in Figure 1. While population growth is poised to plateau at approximately 10B by 2050, technology is developing at an exponential rate. There is an opportunity to engage the public in harnessing technological advancements for mutual benefit avoiding traditional pitfalls. On the one hand this enables development of technology that is desirable and on the other it engages the public in the design process thereby connecting them to the science and technology that flies them. This integrative feature is needed in a world where many are disconnected from the systems they use. The disconnect leads to people being susceptible to misinformation that can be harmful as seen with the latest COVID-19 pandemic. Cloud services and gamification enable this novel engagement between citizen scientists and NASA, providing the opportunity to leverage a diverse population in data generation for AI, vehicle design, ideation and analysis facilitated by NASA. This is called democratized design. New trends in manufacturing and construction such as 3D printing of houses, modular manufacturing [8], offsite construction, and microfactories will allow people or communities to print their own vehicles. These print centers may initially need only the ability to certify production of new vehicles and take into account regulations that need to be adhered to. However, with the increased demand for customization and personalization, the ability to design unique vehicles may present new opportunities. In addition, more accessible development systems will allow new market opportunities for small businesses. This is called democratized development.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>With the increase in income inequality, there is an accepted threat of civil unrest, as evidenced by growing protests related to politics and economics. A focus on Urban Air Mobility that serves urban areas has the potential to exacerbate these differences by providing infrastructure, mobility and access to wealthier passengers. With an estimated 68% of world population living in cities by 2030, poorer populations may remain grounded in even more congested traffic than today, leading to further resentment. Democratized deployment seeks to provide increased access for all through operations that enable mobile services such as schools, groceries, medical supplies. These may be incorporated into the regional and urban air mobility operations. Democratized deployment also considers the use of novel partnerships between aviation and power generation, aviation and housing and civil and military aviation for the public good.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Decisioning for Ecosystem Wellness:</h3><p><span>As the world becomes more interconnected, the complex ecosystems that we rely on such as the transportation (aviation) system, power generation system and residential systems, are more susceptible to disruptions &ndash; whether via market forces, acquisition by competitors, climate change disasters or terrorism. Evidence of this is in the impact on airline tourism due to computer chip shortages. The chip shortage that resulted from bottlenecks in semiconductor production resulted in decreased output of new cars that are increasingly dependent on electronics. The pandemic prompted car rental companies to sell vehicles due to lack of demand. When travel restrictions on flying were lifted, the shortage of new cars being produced resulted in a lack of rental cars due to the inability of car rentals to buy new inventory. Thus, travelers wishing to travel to vacation destinations are unable to rent cars and thus may choose not to travel. There is a need to map these ecosystems and their connections so that changes anywhere in the system can immediately be traced to their impacts whether in the present or to forecast potential challenges in the future. This enables decision makers to respond to challenges dynamically and intelligently to maintain the wellness of the ecosystem. Wellness may be defined by desirable properties of the ecosystem such that the system is constantly adjusting to achieve greater wellness. Wellness refers to an objective, yet relative, set of principles that the system strives to achieve either through trade-offs or synergies. These include equitable access, transparent impacts, trust, security and improved health of humans, human systems and the environment. With the growth in non-traditional aviation markets and the increased access to personalization, there is a need to automate regulations, certifications, reviews and to recognize and trace changes in requirements to assure the public of safety.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><span>Well-being </span><a href=\"https://iaap-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1758-0854.2010.01035.x\"><span>https://iaap-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1758-0854.2010.01035.x</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol><ol><li><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1009930313242?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;CJEVENT=2cbd5791f7d111ec8239110b0a82b824&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_BOOKS_ECOM_GL_PHSS_ALWYS_DEEPLINK&amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;utm_term=PID100357191&amp;?utm_medium=affiliate\"><span>What is a healthy ecosystem? | SpringerLin</span></a>k</li></ol><ul><li><strong><span>Decisioning: </span></strong><span>relevant actions made by singular or collective participants of the ecosystem</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong><span>Ecosystem: </span></strong><span>the relationships and dependencies, expressed or implied, between humans, human systems, and the environment.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><ul><li><strong><span>Wellness:</span></strong><span> Balancing (while maximizing) the fulfillment of needs from the lowest level of the ecosystem (people) to the highest level (ecosystem) with creating equity, trust, transparency and security in the system.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><ul><li><strong><span>Ecosystem</span></strong><span> - A community supported by the structure of interacting (through resources and ideas) organizations/institutions and individuals/people &mdash;the organisms of the business world.

Additionally, when talking about natural ecosystem health and wellness, you are generally trying to sustain the ecosystem&rsquo;s structure in the face of changing conditions (Resilience) to preserve its functions. These functions are felt by the systems, subsytems (species) and impact their health and wellness. If the functions need to change, then changing the structure is a necessity. In nature this happens in a feedback loop involving adaptation, extinction and climate change.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ecosystem health is defined as &ldquo;the state or condition of an ecosystem in which its </span><strong><span>dynamic attributes</span></strong><span> are expressed within the </span><strong><span>normal ranges of activity</span></strong><span> relative to its </span><strong><span>ecological state of development</span></strong><span>&rdquo; (van Andel and Aronson, 2006), while ecosystem integrity is &ldquo;the state or condition of an ecosystem that displays the biodiversity characteristic of the reference, such as species composition and community structure, and is fully capable of sustaining normal ecosystem functioning&rdquo; (SER, 2002)</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><em>What are the dynamic attributes?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>What are normal ranges? Do we want to maintain this or move toward optimal?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>What is its state of development and how to map normal ranges to each state?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Ecosystem integrity is about the structure of the ecosystem.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br /></p><p><span>Adaptation from James Moore&rsquo;s concept of Ecosystem: </span><span>A community supported by the structure of interacting (through resources and ideas) organizations/institutions and individuals/people &mdash;the organisms of the business world. The economic community produces goods and services (functions) of value (and consequence) to people, who are themselves members of the ecosystem. The member organisms also include suppliers, lead producers, competitors, and other stakeholders.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>What this means then is subjective and changes over time. There is no agreement on whether to track GDP, wealth, happiness, prosperity. So I suggest skipping this layer.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We can use trend analysis across demographics to determine what people want/need to move them (individuals and society) up Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Foundational needs should supersede other needs when distributing resources.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>Physiological</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Security/Safety</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Belonging</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Esteem</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Self-actualization</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span>There are some attributes that the ecosystem should try to address for the individual and these can be derived from the CDC, WHO etc. and relate to Maslow&rsquo;s.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Health and wellbeing: The CDC (Centers for Disease Control) summarize attributes of well-being as the &ldquo;presence of positive emotions and moods (e.g., contentment, happiness), the absence of negative emotions (e.g., depression, anxiety), satisfaction with life, fulfillment and positive functioning&rdquo;.

Decisioning systems are coming online with the rise of artificial intelligence, blockchain and the cloud. In healthcare, trends indicate a focus on mental health, life extension, gene editing/therapies, AI drug discovery and nanomedicine, consistent with trends in other industries aimed at miniaturization, deep exploration, speed and safety. At the same time, perceived threats to privacy, increasing pandemic risk and spread through aviation and rising income inequality are creating greater cause for concern for global health and wellness. Aviation plays a major role in the medical supply chain while also being the cause of physical and mental health issues. Fragile supply chains and labor shortages pervade aviation and the health and wellness industry.

(to account for the growing trans-oceanic medical tourism industry))</strong></p><ul><li><em>SubProblem:</em><ul><li>If in-flight incidents become more common, how might they be handled with minimal loss of life?</li></ul></li><li><em>Sources:</em><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.health-tourism.com/medical-tourism/statistics/\">Medical Tourism Statistics and Facts | Health-Tourism.com</a></li></ul></li><li><em>Why is this a problem?</em><ul><li>The aviation industry has taken on new roles given the ability to provide increasingly complex medical care in flight. Reliance on these increasingly more competent capabilities allows travel where it previously was restricted due to health reasons. However, in flight medical capabilities have their limitations, and unforeseen events can turn a standard flight into a medical emergency. 83% of US adults said it is difficult to afford or the costs are unreasonable for prescription drugs. 30% do not take medicine as prescribed due to costs.</li><li>The average spending per visit now rests at $3,000 - $10,000 per tourist.</li><li>Estimates show growth of costs in the future. Medical tourism is a last resort to treat an illness like cancer that may be too aggressive or invasive for treatment back home.</li><li>We assume that the use of medical tourism (transportation to treatment) will increase as costs of treatment increase and access to advanced treatment by rural and disparate communities decreases.</li><li>We also assume that the environment in the plane is not conducive to proper medical response at this time. We are not concerned with &ldquo;airplane hospitals,&rdquo; but with commercial transit for medical tourists that need emergent treatment (for inflight emergencies) or inflight treatment/stabilization to get to their destination.</li><li>MISSING IMAGE</li><li>MISSING IMAGE</li></ul></li><li><em>What capabilities may be needed to address the problem?</em><ul><li>Improved mobile health care provided by increasingly comprehensive suite of medical technology. Flying after surgery can increase the risk for blood clots, including deep vein thrombosis. If you get chest or abdominal surgery do not travel by air for at least 10 days to avoid risks associated with changes in atmospheric pressure. People who get cosmetic procedures of the face, eyelids, or nose, or who have had laser treatments should wait 7&ndash;10 days before flying.</li><li>For in-transit medical support, we suppose that future systems might need additional light-weight machines or monitors. They might need extra refrigeration or custom storage for medical materials. They might need in-flight wifi with dedicated bandwidth for emergency or medical communications or monitoring. They might need modified seating space or alterations to cabin pressure settings/standards to accommodate environmental risks. They might need modified doors or removable seating to accommodate temporary changes to get patients on or off. They might need changes to air-quality (e.g.&nbsp;immunocompromised patients).</li></ul></li><li><em>What trends might enable problem exploration and solution?</em><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.mddionline.com/design-engineering/big-prospects-medical-device-miniaturization\">https://www.mddionline.com/design-engineering/big-prospects-medical-device-miniaturization</a></li><li>There is a notable and significant trend towards miniaturization of health care tools such as diagnostic and treatment capabilities.</li><li>Further, the introduction of automated systems and artificial intelligence can provide guidance even to professional caregivers.</li><li>Telehealth is making professional healthcare support more accessible and available.</li><li>Such developments are an extension of the revolution in healthcare that has enabled both airlift helicopters as well as ambulances to do much more for the patient in transit then previously conceivable.</li></ul></li><li><em>Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem?</em><ul><li>Scores: <em>10M and 100k</em></li><li>The overall community affected by this change in health care availability is relatively small. However, to that community this is a critical and life changing issue. U.S. outbound medical tourists are thought to make up about 10% of the worldwide total. Data from a U.S. government survey suggest that 150,000 to 320,000 U.S. travelers list healthcare as a reason for traveling abroad each year, or between 0.2% and 0.6% of all outbound U.S. air travelers.</li><li>We believe that a large portion of medical tourism is currently related to prescription drugs. As trends above continue, we expect more in-plane medical needs, but it is difficult to determine total size over the next 15-30yrs. 10M globally might have moderate improvement to safety from solving this problem. 100k per year might be able to access lifesaving, critical procedures.</li></ul></li><li><em>Impact - What is the scale of the impact? (high, medium, low)</em><ul><li>See above. Split the population between moderate improvement and critical to safety.</li><li>Scores: <em>3 (10M) and 4 (100k)</em></li></ul></li><li><em>Confidence - How confident are we in the impact and reach determinations?</em><ul><li>There&rsquo;s so much we don&rsquo;t know about the denial of travel that COULD be air-based. Who wants to fly for treatment but can&rsquo;t? But we are concerned that this may be an underestimation. We could not find clear data on future projections for this problem.</li><li>Scores: <em>3 &ldquo;Somewhat Confident&rdquo; (10M), 3 &ldquo;Somewhat Confident&rdquo; (100k)</em></li></ul></li><li><em>Effort &ndash; what is the effort/scale needed to address? Wickedness? CAS-worthy?</em><ul><li>One possible approach to this issue maybe the integration of the technology being developed for astronaut healthcare for long duration missions with commercial aviation sources. This may provide a new level of complexity in what is available in aviation for health care.</li></ul></li></ul>",

This lack of representation compromises generalizability, hinders innovation, impacts trust in the medical system, and compounds health disparities of communities without access.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul></li><li><em><span>What capabilities may be needed to address the problem?</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span><ul><li><span>Often, clinical trials are centered around academic or research institutions limiting participation by a broader sampling of the population. Capabilities to address this problem revolve around improving the ability for patients to participate, or, effectively, bringing the clinical trial to the patients.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>For example, travel impacts out-of-pocket costs to patients, typically driving remote patients out of studies. Distance as a driver of disparity has been specifically established as a cause of lack participation by rural communities.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Thus, one capability to improve participation would be to increase the </span><em><span>accessibility to transportation</span></em><span> in rural communities.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Further, </span><em><span>telemedicine and virtual or localized trial treatments</span></em><span> may broaden the geographic diversity.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>While some aspects of this transformation are more related to overall trends in health care technology, the ability to provide </span><em><span>well equipped mobile airborne laboratories</span></em><span> could impact the ability to increase participation in clinical trials in rural communities.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Beyond issues related to location, there is in general a lack of participation by racial and ethnic minority populations for a variety of socio-economic reasons. Specific outreach may be required to these populations, so investment in greater capabilities in community coordination.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul></li><li><em><span>What trends might enable problem exploration and solution?</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span><ul><li><span>A broadening of capabilities in aviation to allow more democratized transportation and the ability to bring more comprehensive health care capabilities, including clinical trial participation, no I don&rsquo;t to remote regions;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Increasing level of capabilities due to technical advances allowing more localized and effective health care.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>The trend in cost of flying will dictate further difficulties in equity. Cost has decreased over multiple decades, but may be stabilizing now (need to confirm). Is the cost reduction impacting all communities or is it simply cheaper to fly from urban to urban centers or tourist destinations? Are airline hubs co-located with medical research centers? </span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cost-of-flying-has-decreased-2015-10\"><span>The Cost of Flying Has Decreased in the Last 20 Years (businessinsider.com)</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-airfare-has-barely-budged-in-25-years-11628600401\"><span>https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-airfare-has-barely-budged-in-25-years-11628600401</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Complexity of medical research (tighter comparative results mean harder statistical thresholds to overcome).</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Gene-based medicines may require much more research to validate or may very expressly not apply to certain unvalidated populations. </span></li><li><strong><span>TO-DO &ndash; Add source on gene-therapy based drug study results (and the ethical issues) <ac:link><ri:user ri:userkey=\"03ee4cc48009a5ee0180769ab4940073\" /></ac:link> </span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul></li><li><em><span>Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem?</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span><ul><li><span>Very High - 1 Billion</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>US Participation was 28% of the total representation in global Clinical trials in 2015. The problem in the US is also then a global representation problem. With personalized genetic mods, medicine, this will become worse. With Climate change, disease and medical impacts will also worsen in the most distressed areas and populations (not currently studied). Specific rural communities are impacted by this problem already within the US. For example, distance as a driver of disparity has been specifically established for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations who are more likely to live far away from research centers.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Academic centers conduct 55% of the NIH extramural research and operate 98% of the cancer centers. Participation in these activities is biased by the proximity to these centers. However, more broadly, effective clinical trials as a method for improved treatment and drug development has an impact on the population as a whole. Limiting the effectiveness of these trials because of a lack of participation by significant population subgroups narrows the trial&rsquo;s impact and reduces benefits to society beyond the immediate drug and research.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul></li><li><em><span>Impact - What is the scale of the impact?</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span><ul><li><span>Score: 4</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>More disease due to climate change.

Rather, to the extent that autonomous and automated systems become an aspect of health care, a new set of medical ethics concerns arise. Patient monitoring is necessary during medical transport. If this involves an autonomous or automated transportation system, then That patient information resides with in that autonomous or automated system and it needs to be handled appropriately. Timely delivery of supplies and services by whatever means is a core foundation of health care. If an autonomous or automated system fails in its designated function, that failure just </span><em><span>impacts individual health care</span></em><span> and an understanding of responsibility or liability is needed_.

The complexity of health care provided by, for example, emergency air evacuation services has increased over the years. The overall trend is that more can be done locally rather than in a centralized hospital setting. A second trend is changes in the air transportation system is envisioned over time to allow new forms of both personal air transport_ as well as also delivery of supply and materials.

Related to emergency transport and care, the population may be limited and more concentrated in rural areas. However other forms of medical transport are much more common. For example, professional transport a patient from one health care facility to another is a relatively common occurrence within parameters dictated by legal and health insurance regulations.

Medical doctors working in rural areas of Peru have a range of barriers impacting the diagnostic process, and ideas for diagnostic innovations that could assist them. In Ohio, when the death rates for leading causes of death are broken down by geography, Appalachian and rural counties have the highest rates for all the causes, except stroke. This means that if a person is diagnosed with any of these conditions, they are more likely to die if they live in rural or Appalachian counties. In 2014, many deaths among rural Americans were potentially preventable, including 25,000 from heart disease, 19,000 from cancer, 12,000 from unintentional injuries, 11,000 from chronic lower respiratory disease, and 4,000 from stroke. The percentages of deaths that were potentially preventable were higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Some 46 million Americans &mdash; 15 percent of the U.S. population &mdash; currently live in rural areas.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>Who are the key actors?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">By definition, this work concentrates on small player in rural areas who may not be well served by the larger health care systems.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What are the PESTELE problems?</em><ol class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Political and Economic:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>There are health system-related barriers such as limited funding for diagnostic services, shortage of specialists, limited laboratory services and access to telecommunications, and lack of institutional support. This particularly impacts low- and middle-income patients</li><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Social:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Patient related barriers to follow through with diagnostic referrals.</li><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Technological:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Tests were lacking for: i) the differential diagnosis of malaria vs. pneumonia, ii) dengue vs. leptospirosis, iii) tuberculosis, iv) vaginal infections and cervical cancer, v) neurocysticercosis, and vi) heavy metal toxicity. Ultrasound was needed for the diagnosis of obstetric and intra-abdominal conditions. Further, screening for a ride range of cancers needs to be increased notably.</li><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Legal:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The core concept that Healthcare is fundamentally inferior in some parts of the country than others could in principle be pursued legally. This leads to an Issue whether healthcare is a right or a commodity.</li><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Environmental:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Rural communities may be challenged by different health problems than urban areas given the proximity to wildlife and/or wild habitat.</li></ol></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What is the connection to aviation?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">Technological innovations such as POC diagnostic tools and mobile-health applications could help address part of the problem. However, other types of innovation to address social, adaptation and policy issues should not be dismissed.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What solutions are currently being worked?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">The standard diagnostic tools would still not be adequate for the rural facilities due to the high costs, limited infrastructure, and lack of specialized personnel. This perception is consistent with repeated calls for more appropriate diagnostic technology that is viable for resource-poor settings globally.</li><li class=\"code-line\">Some technologies have already been realized in primary care practice. Glucometers transformed the speed and ease of obtaining accurate blood glucose levels, and urine dipsticks removed the need for microscopy in many patients. Advances in electronics have also made in-roads into general practice, with cheap and generally accurate blood pressure devices now widely available both in the practice and at home. Similarly point-of-care tests have now been developed for many common blood tests, such as lipid profiles, HbA1c, C-reactive protein, INR, and urine albumin-creatinine ratio.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What statistics and notable trends are there?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">&quot;In medical school, you learn all these like strange, random diseases that they tell you you're never ever going to see in your life,&quot; she said. &quot;And through my rotations, I've seen almost all of them in a rural setting, especially because people will kind of wait on things. They don't want to go to the doctor. They don't want to bother themselves with it. And then weird stuff pops up, and then it walks in your door, and you've got to figure out what to do with it&quot;</li><li class=\"code-line\">According to the National Rural Health Association, 20% of Americans live in rural areas, but only 9% of doctors practice there.</li><li class=\"code-line\">Appalachian and rural counties in Ohio have the highest rates for all the leading causes, except stroke.

Further, being able to provide Point of Care portable devices that have at least comparable prescreening capabilities of more complex systems that can be broadly distributed (democratization) and can be used in a home setting can strongly impact health care costs.</li><li class=\"code-line\">FDA approval of new technologies is challenging and costly procedure. Moving technologies from lab to the home is may still be done by larger institutions that can afford the process and already control market share. Thus, market changing impact of new technologies may be challenged by economic barriers.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Social:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Acceptance and trust of new technologies is a challenge, especially for patients are not familiar with new technologies.

Bacteria have evolved to resist the presence of these heavy metals, producing traits that also shield them from antibiotics.</li><li class=\"code-line\">Normally heavy metals are lethal to bacteria because of the free emission of ions that disrupt cell functions.</li><li class=\"code-line\">&quot;Bacteria are continuously exposed to heavy metals present in the natural habitats due to the ungoverned release of industrial and agricultural effluents, thereby resulting in the survival of the metal-tolerant cells due to mutations. Resistance to heavy metals in pathogens has been associated with the acquisition of extrinsic resistance determinants. Antibiotic Resistance genes (ARGs) containing Class 1 integrons and gene cassettes in microbes have been reported in samples collected from sewage treatment plants, which indicates the co-selection of metal and antibiotic resistance-associated genes. Such co-selection also raises serious concerns regarding ungoverned dumping of metal-ridden industrial and agricultural effluents. Once these effluents are dumped in the open, they form waste reservoirs which contribute towards the maintenance and transfer of ARGs in pathogens.&quot;</li><li class=\"code-line\">&quot;In addition to lead, other metals have been linked to the appearance of drug-resistant microbes. A recent study by scientists at Florida A&amp;M University examined a former nuclear material test site in South Carolina with persistent levels of uranium and mercury in its soil. The site contained a strain of bacteria resistant to 70 percent of antibiotics tested against it.&quot;</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>Who are the key actors?</em><ol class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">Heavy metal polluters</li><li class=\"code-line\">Industry</li><li class=\"code-line\">Agriculture</li><li class=\"code-line\">Sewage mgmt</li><li class=\"code-line\">Ore mining &amp; smelting</li><li class=\"code-line\">Thermal power plants</li><li class=\"code-line\">Metallurgical processes</li><li class=\"code-line\">Animal feed industry</li><li class=\"code-line\">Regulators</li><li class=\"code-line\">Antibiotic over-users</li><li class=\"code-line\">Farmers / Meat producers</li><li class=\"code-line\">Hospital &amp; Health Systems</li><li class=\"code-line\">Patients</li></ol></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What are the PESTELE problems?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Political:</strong><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">Pollution is cross-border and multi-sourced.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Economic:</strong><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">Value of short-term control of this pollution might exceed the value of the lives saved, but danger will likely increase over time faster than we can adapt.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Social:</strong><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">Cities, countries, areas most impacted by this are the least wealthy.

A systematic literature review was performed to capture the dynamics surrounding drones and to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of what has been studied so far and what needs to be investigated in the future. 55 publications were selected and thoroughly analyzed. The findings of this study illustrate that the potential strengths of applying drones in SCM and logistics are: (1) support of humanitarian logistics, (2) reduced delivery time, (3) reduced cost, (4) improved flexibility, and (5) increased sustainability. In addition, the challenges posed by drones in SCM and logistics are grouped into technical, organizational, safety-related, and regulatory issues. This study also investigates real-life drone deployments in SCM and logistics and sets forth an agenda for future research.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>Who are big players?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">Medical organizations seeking to deliver supplies to difficult-access locations; package delivery businesses seeking to optimize &quot;last-mile&quot; delivery operations; internet service providers in need of an aerial platform over remote areas; search and rescue organizations (e.g., firefighters) in need of a surveillance platform.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What are PESTELE problems?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Economic:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Cost of supporting infrastructure for drone operations.</li><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Social:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Privacy and security issues</li><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Technical:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Limited payload and range; operational limitations due to weather.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What is the connection to aviation?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\"><em>Role aviation currently plays:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Drones are flight vehicles.</li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>Impact on aviation:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Large numbers of drones may affect other aircraft operating in the same local airspace.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What solutions are currently being worked?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">UTM (Unmanned aerial system Traffic Management) system is being developed by NASA and FAA to safely and efficiently integrate drone operations into the national airspace system where other vehicles also fly.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What statistics and notable trends are there?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">The drone logistics and transportation market is expected to reach $29B by 2027.</li></ul></li></ul>",

This can be addressed by restoring reliability and safety across the medical cargo supply chain. The primary issue is the difficulty of handling temperature-sensitive medical cargo across the entire supply chain in a safe and secure manner. The whole supply chain in the air cargo industry involves a lot of handling points of the cargo. There are a lot of different stakeholders that handle the cargo and each individual link in the chain needs to be up to standard, otherwise the whole quality of the supply chain can be lost.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>Who are big players?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">Airports</li><li class=\"code-line\">air cargo carriers</li><li class=\"code-line\">medical cargo businesses.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What are PESTELE problems?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Economic:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Lost revenue for air cargo carriers.</li><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Social:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Possible ill effects of temperature-spoiled medical cargo</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What PESTELE issues impact the topic that we are addressing (document title)</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">Same as above.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What is the connection to aviation?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\"><em>Role aviation currently plays:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Air transportation of medical cargo. -<em>Impact on aviation:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Lost revenue due to limited market share of aviation industry.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What solutions are currently being worked?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">IATA helped create the Center of Excellence for Independent Validators (CEIV) in pharmaceutical logistics, a global quality standard based on good distribution guidelines.

Besides highlighting the characteristics of climate change and the ongoing pandemic, this study focuses on the analysis of the main effects and consequences that these phenomena have produced on the city and the vulnerabilities of the urban system. To understand how these events have impacted the urban environment, directly and indirectly, this research undertakes to define some specific indicators capable of comparing the phenomena and assessing their repercussions. The Methodology is based on the following focal points: on the analysis of the urban shocks that have affected the cities in the last decade, on the comparison between contemporary survey data and those relating to historical trends, on the definition of the main urban sectors particularly affected by the onset of urban shocks, and on the definition of strategies, actions, and tools deemed to be effective in the implementation of a post-pandemic and climate-proof city. These results were achieved through complementary urban design and tools capable of creating a post-pandemic and climate-proof adaptive city, within a cross-disciplinary approach</li><li class=\"code-line\"><ac:image ac:class=\"loading\" ac:alt=\"MISSING IMAGE\"><ri:url ri:value=\"https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/c%3A/Users/javilla8/Documents/RackMultipart20220819-1-edupq7_html_d8b02f55c2dfa5a2.jpg\" /></ac:image></li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>Who are big players?</em></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What are PESTELE problems?</em></li><li class=\"code-line\"><em>What is the connection to aviation?</em><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">Infrastructure services (connection to infrastructure bill, airports, EV investment and AAM?)</li><li class=\"code-line\">Emergency response (cost, proximity, capability)</li><li class=\"code-line\">Resource use (supply chain, aviation, health)</li><li class=\"code-line\">How might aviation benefit &ndash; Climatology (survey, predict, modify), Geography (where to build, connect to architecture, drones already in use), Geology (, Geotechnics, Hydraulic Engineering, Transport and Mobility Engineering, Materials and Architecture Engineering, and Urban Planning &ndash; These are all critical to resilient city design with resilience toward climate and climate related pandemic, pathogen spread.</li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\"><ac:image ac:class=\"loading\" ac:alt=\"MISSING IMAGE\"><ri:url ri:value=\"https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/c%3A/Users/javilla8/Documents/RackMultipart20220819-1-edupq7_html_a27c00f6147ee9f3.png\" /></ac:image><ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\"><strong>Figure 3.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Main resilient urban strategies related to investigated factors.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li class=\"code-line\">Workforce Management:<ul class=\"code-line\"><li class=\"code-line\">Nurses and nursing staff do an awful lot of lifting in performing their jobs.

Given that the impacts of climate engineering range from local crop damage to global conflicts and refugee migrations, there is an urgency to understand the motivations behind geoengineering, the actors involved in implementing various strategies, the communities impacted by the consequences and consequences themselves. While aviation&rsquo;s role in climate change is relatively small, its connection to wider societal leverage points may provide a mechanism to address climate change through geoengineering while avoiding or reducing the negative impacts.</span></p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong><span> &lt;keyword1&gt;, &lt;keyword 2&gt; (.e. </span>Pandemic, aviation, mental health, workforce, supply chain, democratization, distributed systems, medicine, demographics, regulations, ethics)</p><p><strong>Areas of Convergence:</strong><span> &lt;area 1&gt;, &lt;area 2&gt; (i.e. </span>sensors, miniaturization, ethics, AI, privacy, security, Distributed trust, distributed orchestration)</p><p><strong>Supporting Trends:</strong><span> &lt;trend1&gt;, &lt;trend 2&gt; (i.e. </span>ageing population, increased climate change driven resource shortages, hospital consolidation, direct-to-consumer healthcare, medical staff shortages, advanced air mobility, commerical drone delivery, antibiotic resistance, number of pandemics and diseases expected to rise)</p><p><strong>Solution Vectors:</strong><span> &lt;solution 1&gt;, &lt;solution 2&gt; (i.e. </span>distributed trust, distributed orchestration, government role in regulation, leveraging lessons from developing world)</p><p><strong>Dates:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>XXXX to YYYY</p><p><br /></p>",

There are bio based SAF for example and in this particular case using bio crops to develop plastic as opposed to using fossil fuels as part of the development cycle.&nbsp; But these alternative bio pathways may create more problems in addition to their solutions.</p><p>PROBLEM: The idea is to use bio crops and plantation methods in the cycle of production for whatever product (plastics, SAF etc.).&nbsp; While this would indeed eliminate the need for fossil fuel based energy into the development cycle and also help with existing GHG sequestration (vi the plants in the bio cycle part) they also create significant challenges in that large amounts of area would need to be dedicated to these bio pathways.&nbsp; These areas would then directly complete with areas needed for food production.&nbsp; These areas would also still need large energy expenditures such as that for watering itself a valuable and more tricky resource.&nbsp;

And you should probably know that&rsquo;s a</li><li>contested concept for some people. There are two broad genres. There&rsquo;s solar radiation management and there&rsquo;s</li><li>carbon dioxide removal that people often put under the rubric of geoengineering.</li><li>A lot of carbon dioxide removal folks don&rsquo;t want to be under the rubric of geoengineering I think primarily because</li><li>they&rsquo;re afraid of having their approaches lumped in with the SRM approaches, which as we can discuss in a moment,</li><li>could have far more serious implications. But assuming that one puts them both under the rubric of geoengineering,</li><li>we can talk about what&rsquo;s out there.</li><li>So, most of the research that&rsquo;s occurring, most of the funding that&rsquo;s occurring is occurring on the carbon dioxide</li><li>removal side. In the United States, there is now in the Biden administration&rsquo;s funding pipeline about $12 billion for a</li><li>combination of carbon capture and storage which is not geoengineering under most classifications and carbon</li><li>dioxide removal.</li><li>And so, the distinction there is carbon capture and storage capture CO2 from the flue gas, so from the point of</li><li>combustion, whereas carbon dioxide removal removes the CO2 from the atmosphere, okay?</li><li>But a large chunk of that $12 billion funding is for carbon removal and it&rsquo;s mostly in the field of direct air capture but</li><li>there&rsquo;s also funding for enhancing sequestration from soils, developing new methodologies for measuring</li><li>afforestation and reforestation, a little bit on enhanced mineral weathering, biochar, bioenergy with carbon capture</li><li>and storage and so forth.</li></ul></li><li><h4>[OBS TITLE PLACEHOLDER]</h4><strong>Sources:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Trend</strong><ul><li>To the extent possible, if the natural feedbacks can be used, the extent of global warming can be mitigated.</li></ul></li><li><h4>[OBS TITLE PLACEHOLDER]</h4><strong>Sources:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Takeaway</strong><ul><li>What decisions need to be made?

They form and persist only in regions of the atmosphere that are cold and humid enough. Individual contrails trap outgoing longwave radiation and cause a warming effect, but can also reflect incoming solar radiation with a cooling component. On aggregate, however, the consensus is a net warming effect and its annual climate forcing could be equal or higher than the cumulative CO2 that is emitted by aviation since its inception. In this presentation, we will model the contrail climate forcing in the North Atlantic region over 5 years and identify the set of factors that are associated with highly warming/cooling contrails. New mitigation ideas are then devised based on these findings, including a targeted use of sustainable aviation fuels and prioritising mitigation for flights with the highest probability of forming strongly warming contrails.</li></ul></li><li><h4>[OBS TITLE PLACEHOLDER]</h4><strong>Sources:</strong><ul><li><a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/style/article/ice-stupa-sonam-wangchuk/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/style/article/ice-stupa-sonam-wangchuk/index.html</a><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Problem</strong></li><li>Problem - glaciers are shrinking due to rising global temperatures.

This approach would result in quick cooling not needing a slow ramp up as CDR to produce results but if stopped the effect created does not last.</span></li></ul><p><span>These approaches are not exclusive and both can be pursued independent or in conjunction to each other. There are significant uncertainties and not well understood possible negative effects in both of them.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Climate change and any geoengineering interventions performed as a result will impact aviation at many levels, in areas such as technology, logistics, operations and perhaps existential.&nbsp; For example it is known that aircraft contrails can aid in reflecting sunlight (a form of SRM) so we have seen sources comment on the feasibility of changing current aircraft routes to both create the effect in desired locations and to also allow aircraft to not interfere with each other&rsquo;s contrails so as to extend said effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; There could be pressure to accelerate the transition to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) or other energy modes.&nbsp; Either of these would significantly impact current models of operations and value/cost.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But while these effects will impact aviation it is clear to us that aviation as a whole can also have significant impacts on the climate change/geoengineering problem space.&nbsp; Aviation is a factor in GHG production but it could also be well positioned as a tool platform for active geoengineering interventions and/or passive sensing and tracking of its effects both of which are needed.&nbsp; A tool platform with a long and rich history of experience in its use and operations.&nbsp; Given the level of uncertainties around geoengineering interventions the availability of such a well understood platform is rather helpful.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></span></p><p><span>If we fast forward 50+ years from now and imagine that a regional or global geoengineering effort is initiated, aircraft will most likely be required to play major roles particularly if SRM is performed.&nbsp; One of the most promising method for SRM is to inject aerosols into the atmosphere via aircraft.&nbsp; While still a complex, large and costly operation it is more feasible, cost vs. viability, than orbital reflectors for example.&nbsp; This is due to the already existing levels of experience around aircraft deployment and operations. Opportunities for current vehicles and/or new, high flying, long loiter platforms, possibly unmanned are likely. Previous (McClellan 2010) and current (Smith 2022) geoengineering cost analyses of various concept of operations are </span><span>available, and</span><span> can serve as anchor points for new studies that predict the costs and concepts of future aviation-geoengineering operations, as well as to&nbsp;determine their feasibility and estimate the costs and impacts of inaction. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If we assume that aircraft will be involved in the deliberate dispersion of particulate materials in the atmosphere to alter climate, it is possible that new actors will require the aircraft industry to actively participate in data and sample collection campaigns that inform the geoengineering operations. If this is true, the aircraft industry would experience significant impacts that may include but are not limited to new flight paths, and changes to </span><span>aircraft</span><span> hardware/software upgrades, as well as requirements to accommodate air sampling, collection, and analysis platforms, instruments, and technologies. </span><span>&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>We predict that environmental monitoring of the air that planes fly through - as well as the impacts they have on the atmosphere&nbsp;as they fly through it - will need to be closely monitored at the highest spatial and temporal resolutions possible to inform geoengineering models and subsequent operations, which would naturally make all aircraft in the National Airspace prime candidates for participation. </span><span>&nbsp;This scenario could actually develop to some extent even if no geoengineering interventions is undertaken locally but as a method for detection and attribution of possible interventions undertaken by others</span><a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\"><span>[3]</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>We note that requiring commercial vehicles to accommodate sensor platforms that serve a government geoengineering function may be very challenging to achieve. If industry is not favorable to implementation of these notional operational and technical changes, entire new fleets of aircraft may be required: to monitor impacts and&nbsp;implement the desired outcomes of geoengineering efforts as directed by future actors. A &ldquo;</span><span>GeoForce</span><span>&rdquo; of aircraft, manned and unmanned. </span><span>&nbsp;A much simplified but analogous example are the fleets of water-spraying UAVs in Bangkok, Thailand in 2019 (figure 1 and 2), whose exploratory mission was to reduce PM2.5 in the local atmosphere (Simon, 2019). &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<ac:image ac:style=\"max-height: 250.0px;\" ac:thumbnail=\"true\" ac:height=\"152\"><ri:attachment ri:filename=\"image2023-1-24_16-11-22.png\" /></ac:image> <ac:image ac:style=\"max-height: 250.0px;\" ac:thumbnail=\"true\" ac:height=\"152\"><ri:attachment ri:filename=\"image2023-1-24_16-11-31.png\" /></ac:image></p><p>Figure 1 and 2: UAVs dispersing materials to reduce PM2.5 polution. (From Simon, 2019)</p><p><span>Regardless of what level government and industry play in a government-sponsored geoengineering effort, huge quantities of samples and data will be collected, and we envision the need for a new open-access geoengineering data and sample repository. </span></p><p><span>Whether climate change-induced or geoengineering-induced, evolving and increasingly extreme weather patterns will continue to impact aviation. For the industry to be able to continue providing reliable products and services to customers worldwide, the industry will need to adapt and incorporate climate change awareness across all operational and business models. </span></p><p><br /></p><p><span>McClellan, J., Sisco, J., Suarez, B. and Keogh, G., 2010.

Transport and communications costs have significantly dropped; at the same time, there have also been reductions in tariffs (and other barriers to international trade) that have opened up the global economy. This opening up of the global economy has led to an overall increase in international economic activity (and, consequently, the importance of international trade in the world economy has also greatly increased). In addition to more market-friendly policies and an acceleration of economic growth, a second major evolution in the forces of globalization occurred as a result of a range of countries&mdash;primarily Asian economies&mdash;becoming more significant economic forces in the international economy. Whereas in the middle of the 20th century, the United States was the primary economic force in the international economy, by the beginning of the 21st century, the European Union (EU), Japan, China, and India all have global significance and impact. It is predicted that, in the future, their importance will become even greater.&quot; <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020915/when-did-globalization-start.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/020915/when-did-globalization-start.asp</a></p></li><li>&quot;In Western Europe and America, economic growth has, not surprisingly, been slower&mdash;typical of already mature economies. In the West, globalization is associated not with faster growth and better prospects, but with fewer middle-class jobs and lower wages, especially in manufacturing. After all, trade with China meant the integration of its huge low-wage labor force into what became a global labor market. It is true that technological change, especially automation, mattered as well, and probably even more, for job losses in the rich world. But globalization can be implicated to the extent that trade and foreign investment have accelerated the spread of new technologies and associated know-how to developing countries&mdash;and thus those countries&rsquo; increasing ability to compete in the production and export of increasingly sophisticated manufactured goods.&quot; <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/middle-class-winners-or-losers-globalized-world\">https://www.cgdev.org/publication/middle-class-winners-or-losers-globalized-world</a></li></ul></li><li><span>Consequences of trend:</span><ul><li><span>&quot;..people living in communities that had been dependent on jobs outsourced elsewhere often suffer.

Today, middle-class households rely predominantly on employment in the service sector, where wages for those without a college degree (67 percent of the U.S. workforce) are lower than in the goods-producing industries where they once worked in larger numbers... For example, Walmart is currently the top private sector employer in Ohio and twenty-one other U.S. states, with average salaries hovering around $29,500 per year.&quot; <span><a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/09/23/reckoning-with-link-between-middle-class-anxieties-and-u.s.-foreign-policy-pub-82729\">https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/09/23/reckoning-with-link-between-middle-class-anxieties-and-u.s.-foreign-policy-pub-82729</a></span></li><li><span>Those harmed by globalization have lashed out both at economic integration, and at the elites they hold responsible for their troubles.

The orders Keynes could place by phone in 1914 could now be placed over the internet. Instead of having them delivered in a few weeks, they would arrive at one&rsquo;s doorstep in a few days. What was more, the internet also allowed for a further global integration of value chains. You could do R&amp;D in one country, sourcing in others, production in yet another, and distribution all over the world. The result has been a globalization on steroids. In the 2000s, global exports reached a milestone, as they rose to about a quarter of global GDP. Trade, the sum of imports and exports, consequentially grew to about half of world GDP. In some countries, like Singapore, Belgium, or others, trade is worth much more than 100% of GDP. A majority of global population has benefited from this: more people than ever before belong to the global middle class, and hundred of millions achieved that status by participating in the global economy.&quot;, <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/how-globalization-4-0-fits-into-the-history-of-globalization/\">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/how-globalization-4-0-fits-into-the-history-of-globalization/</a></p></li><li><p>&quot;Then growth took off across the developing world, and accelerated further during the first decade of this century as those countries &ldquo;globalized,&rdquo; opening their markets to trade and foreign capital, and benefiting from low global interest rates and a global commodity-demanding boom.

Improved fiscal policies within countries and international trade agreements between them also facilitate globalization. Political and economic stability facilitate globalization as well.

We consider three value-driven identities: individualism, focused on status concerns, communitarianism, focused on social affiliations, and multi-affiliatedness, encompassing both objectives. Under endogenous identity formation high-skill people are drawn to individualism, the lower-skilled to communitarianism, and those of intermediate skill to multi-affiliatedness. Skill- and education-biased growth leads to increasing social polarisation, expanding the individualistic and communitarian groups at the expense of multi-affiliates.

Such a tendency means that political fragmentation will naturally emerge in online discussions as people connect to others with similar views. Closely related to homophily is the concept of &ldquo;selective exposure&rdquo;, a phenomenon whereby people select information or sources they already agree with whilst filtering out others... If we consider online discussions as a source of information, then the selective exposure mechanism will produce similar results to the homophily mechanism, as people select themselves into online discussions with which they already agree. A further mechanism identified is the tendency of individuals to moderate their opinions into line with what they perceive the group norm to be, or at least to keep quiet if they believe themselves to be outside this norm...This mechanism means that existing groups of association should become more homogeneous over time (or at least they will appear to).&quot;, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/23/1/17/4832996?login=true\">https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/23/1/17/4832996?login=true</a></span></li><li><span>&quot;Our analysis suggests that under-privileged people need not be irrational to support a policy that reduces their income.

Indeed, we see the same declines in public attitudes toward the two major political parties. In the early 1960s, 70- 75% of people identified with either the Democratic or Republican party; by 2014, that figure had fallen to 56%. Asked whether the main parties were doing an &ldquo;adequate job,&rdquo; 56% said yes in 2003 but only 34% by 2017. Reflecting this alienation from the major parties, the desire for a new third party rose from 40% in 2003 to a significant majority of 62% by 2021.

The simpler the innovation, the easier it is to learn and use, and the more likely it is to be adopted by consumers. Simple innovations are also more likely to disrupt existing markets, as they are often cheaper and/or more effective than existing products or services. The degree of compatibility: The degree of compatibility of an innovation is also a key factor in its disruptive potential. The more compatible the innovation is with the existing system, the less disruptive it is likely to be. In order to be disruptive, an innovation must be incompatible with the status quo, and therefore must offer a better solution to a problem that the status quo cannot solve., The degree of affordability: Affordability is a key factor in disruptive potential, as it is often the reason why an innovation is adopted by consumers. An affordable innovation is more likely to be adopted than an expensive one, as people are more likely to switch to a product or service that is cheaper than the one they are currently using. An affordable innovation is more likely to disrupt an existing market, as it is often cheaper and/or more effective than existing products or services.&quot; <a href=\"https://philmckinney.com/disruptive-innovation-the-theory-behind-how-it-works-and-its-impact-on-society/#:~:text=Disruptive%20innovation%20can%20improve%20society,more%20easily%20than%20ever%20before\">https://philmckinney.com/disruptive-innovation-the-theory-behind-how-it-works-and-its-impact-on-society/#:~:text=Disruptive%20innovation%20can%20improve%20society,more%20easily%20than%20ever%20before</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Demographics impacted<ul><li>&quot;There are three types of disruptions: The first type of disruption is the introduction of a new product or service that differs significantly from and is often superior to the existing one.

During this time, businesses offering the technology may struggle to market an innovative product. The earliest users of disruptive technology may find themselves working with clunky prototypes that don't yet offer the sleek refinement that's presented in later stages of development., Early performance problems: Nearly all innovations go through a period of problem-solving. Modern consumers are accustomed to experiencing this with a newly developed app or piece of software. Updates and patches are necessary to overcome the glitches and other challenges that the technology might present. The same process applies to any disruptive technology and can make early adoption more challenging. Unproven applications: It can take time for a disruptive technology to find its place in the marketplace. The potential applications for the innovation are at first unproven. Users may doubt whether they can use the product to replace its predecessors. For example, when small kitchen appliances were first made available, cooks may have doubted whether electric mixers could deliver the same quality as their own skilled hands.&quot; <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/disruptive-technology\">Disruptive Technology: Definition, Pros vs. Cons and Examples | Indeed.com</a></p></li></ul></li><li>Geographical distribution<br /><ul><li>&quot;First, the locations where technologies are developed that later disrupt businesses are geographically highly concentrated, even more so than overall patenting. Second, as the technologies mature and the number of new jobs related to them grows, they gradually spread geographically. While initial hiring is concentrated in high-skilled jobs, over time the mean skill level in new positions associated with the technologies declines, broadening the types of jobs that adopt a given technology. At the same time, the geographic diffusion of low-skilled positions is significantly faster than higher-skilled ones, so that the locations where initial discoveries were made retain their leading positions among high-paying positions for decades. Finally, these pioneer locations are more likely to arise in areas with universities and high skilled labor pools.&quot;, <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28999/w28999.pdf\">https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28999/w28999.pdf</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><span><span style=\"color: rgb(53,55,64);\"> Growing Inequality: Inequality has been on the rise in many parts of the world, with the gap between the rich and poor growing larger.

Critically, though, the Truman administration harnessed that inheritance toward a strategic end: building a framework around the United States&mdash;grounded in multilateral institutions such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank&mdash;that elevated collective interests over narrow ones and gave Washington an unrivaled ability to convene problem-solving coalitions.

The long-term decline of American intergenerational social mobility (ISM) rates could be attributed to common structural changes in economies and occupational structures across the developed world; to comparatively less advantaged early-life influences related to parenting, family structure, and endowments; or to different national policies in shaping the labor market and educational impacts of structural economic change.....&quot; Also, &quot; There is evidence of strong relationships between life chances and variation in childhood environments related to school quality, neighborhood segregation, population structure, social capital and community cohesion, and family structure.

For example, the average hourly wage in 1964, when converted to 2018 dollars, is $20.27. Compare this to $22.65, the average hourly wage in 2018.

This is evidenced by the rising levels of income and wealth inequality. Currently, those in the top 20% of the income distribution earn nearly nine times more than those in the bottom 20%. This difference is far greater than in the European Union or the United Kingdom. Wealth inequality is even more skewed. In the United States, the top 5% of the population own three-quarters of the entire financial wealth of the country, while the bottom 60% possess less than 1%.&quot;</li><li>&quot;Explanations for the relatively low level of social mobility in the US include the better access of affluent children to superior schools and preparation for schools so important in an economy where pay is tilted toward educated workers; high levels of immigration of unskilled laborers and low rate of unionization, which leads to lower wages among the least skilled; public health problems, like obesity and diabetes, which can limit education and employment, the sheer size of the income gap between the rich which makes it harder to climb the proverbial income ladder when the rungs are farther apart; poverty, since those with low income have significantly lower rates of mobility than middle and higher income individuals.[44] The factors which affect social mobility vary across the United States as does social mobility which in favored areas is much higher than in less favored areas.&quot;, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_mobility_in_the_United_States#cite_note-10\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_mobility_in_the_United_States#cite_note-10</a></li></ul></li><li>Consequences of trend:<ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>The relationship between father-son earnings is tighter in the United States than in most peer OECD countries, meaning U.S. mobility is among the lowest of major industrialized economies.

They may shrink, move to other locations or abandon the market space completely.</li><li>Such retreats, abandonments, reorganizations convulse the market in new and unforeseen ways.</li><li>This all reflects back into tensions in societies, old social contracts (and the views that made them possible) are reevaluated or also abandoned exacerbating QoL and economic issues.</li><li>The shattering of social contracts, expectations and norms make people want to move to better locations this tied to climate change forced migration increases overall populations movements from stressed environments to those perceived to be better.</li><li>GeoPolitical situations change so drastically (whether slow or fast the magnitude is more critical, allies are abandoned, new partnerships are sought, positions are reversed and so on) new power blocks emerge and form.</li><li>Old allies no longer trust each other, social and economic pressures cause some losers (and winners) in this scenario to turn inwards and become more hard line nationalistic in order to maintain any sense of control substituting pride in nation, an aggrieved, victim mentality to coalesce around &quot;hope&quot; for improvements and action.</li><li>Desperation becomes more as nations try to solve the problem anyway they can and in doing so create friction points around which new skirmishes and conflict arise.</li><li>Economic block struggle more and more to survive and begin to collapse, shrinking from the global to the regional.</li></ol></li><li>In general Climate Change will rework the global maps (both physically as in rising sea levels but also politically and economically).</li><li>In principle this problem can be tackled at its source but there is no political focus or power center that can move enough resources to make any significant impact.&nbsp; So whats left consolidates more and more around resources and their value creating new large centers for these populations.</li><li>Warfare could escalate to progress reducing levels and wars of attrition develop and spiral into the stone age.</li><li>Fossil Fuel economy chains collapse in some places and shrink back into these large (&quot;lucky&quot;) new population centers.</li><li>Energy could go back to more mechanical means, water wheels, loaded kink springs (Paulo Bacigalupi), sails, human, in certain areas both economic and geographical.</li><li>These large population centers could supply a &quot;new&quot; source of power: Human Labor.&nbsp; Large Pools of Human Labor.</li></ol></li><li>Looking at these Three Technical Trends:<ol><li>Natural Language Modeling continues to improve and eventually becomes part of the normal UI/UX to machines and processes</li><li>Safety Cases Develop that use AI as part of the Safety Logic Case Chain</li><li>AI begins to move from the Cloud to the Edge with Digital Twins (and in so doing aids Industry in developing an Industrial Metaverse)</li><li>And considering their impact on Climate Change/GeoEnginering one can consider both ways:<ol><li>That perhaps the greater streamlining an optimizing of industrial process can be used to alleviate the climate problem.&nbsp; Or,</li><li>That the greater optimization of industrial processes will spur on the need for more and more energy consumption.&nbsp; More control inspiring more want.</li><li>Alternatively (on the gripping hand) greater insight and control into the industrial process will certainly be of great value to transition to more green economies BUT that transition is still a big transition no matter how much insight and efficiency one has.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p><br /></p>",
