      "You are an AI tasked with imagining dystopian futures based on three inputs: an emerging need, an capability or capability gap, and a trend that is changing over time. With the information below rewrite the SEQUENCE of ACTOR, HOW, WHY into a clear narrative.  Use the tone and style of a sci-fi movie summary. Make the narrative at least 4 paragraphs long. Be very specific about actors, their actions, and the subsequent consequences. \n\nINPUTS:\n-----------------\nNeed: Access to timely medical care in remote or underfunded areas\nTechnology Capability: Delivery of medical equipment and medicines\nTrend:  Increasing use of drones in emergency medical services\n\n\n\nFRAMING:\n-----------------\nTimeframe: 2060\nContext: By 2060, the world has become increasingly reliant on technology, with drones being used for a variety of tasks, including emergency medical services. However, access to timely medical care in remote or underfunded areas remains a challenge.\nCore Problem: The core problem is the lack of access to medical care in remote or underfunded areas, which is exacerbated by the increasing use of drones in emergency medical services. The drones are unable to reach these areas due to their limited range and lack of infrastructure, leaving those in need without access to medical care.\nCause and Effect: The cause of this problem is the lack of infrastructure and resources in remote or underfunded areas, which prevents the delivery of medical equipment and medicines. This lack of access to medical care has a devastating effect on the health and wellbeing of those living in these areas, leading to increased mortality rates and a decrease in quality of life.\nStakeholders: The key stakeholders in this scenario are the individuals and communities living in remote or underfunded areas, as well as the organizations and governments responsible for providing medical care.\nAmplifying Factors: Political and economic factors are amplifying the core problem, as governments and organizations are unable to provide adequate resources to these areas due to budget constraints and other limitations. Additionally, the increasing use of drones in emergency medical services is further limiting access to medical care in remote or underfunded areas.\nCascading Effects: The lack of access to medical care has a cascading effect on other aspects of society, such as education, employment, and economic development. Without access to medical care, individuals and communities are unable to lead healthy and productive lives, leading to a decrease in quality of life and an increase in poverty and inequality.\nInterconnections: The core problem is interconnected with other existing issues, such as poverty, inequality, and lack of access to resources. These issues are further compounded by the lack of access to medical care, creating a complex web of challenges.\nHuman Impact: The human impact of this scenario is immense, as individuals and communities are unable to access the medical care they need. This leads to increased mortality rates, decreased quality of life, and a lack of hope for the future. Additionally, the moral and ethical implications of this situation are significant, as those in need are unable to access the medical care they require.\n\n\nSEQUENCE:\n-----------------\nACTOR:  The United States government\nHOW: Develops a “Medical Drone Network” to address the need for timely medical care in remote areas.\nWHY: As governments around the world are unable to provide adequate resources in these areas due to budget constraints and other limitations, the US government deploys drones to deliver medical equipment and medicines to remote or underfunded areas. This “Medical Drone Network”, an expansion of the existing use of drones for emergency services, however, is controlled by the US government and can only be accessed by obtaining special permissions. \n\nACTOR: Other governments and organizations\nHOW: Introduce legal and regulatory measures to limit or restrict access to the US Medical Drone Network.\nWHY: Fearing the US government’s ability to control access to timely medical care in remote or underfunded areas, other governments and organizations devise legal and regulatory measures aimed at limiting or restricting access to the US “Medical Drone Network”. These measures, however, make it increasingly difficult and expensive to access medical care in these areas, leading to further suffering and hardship.\n\nACTOR: US-based technology companies\nHOW: Develop a proprietary “Robo-Doctor” AI software to provide remote medical consultation and services. \nWHY: In response to the legal and regulatory measures, US-based technology companies develop a proprietary “Robo-Doctor” AI software that is designed to provide remote medical consultation and services. This AI-based software is marketed as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to the US government’s Medical Drone Network. \n\nACTOR: Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)\nHOW: Partner with small-scale and grassroots healthcare providers in remote areas to deliver basic medical care to those who cannot access the US Medical Drone Network or the “Robo-Doctor” AI-based software. \nWHY: In an effort to provide basic medical care to those who cannot access the US government’s Medical Drone Network or the “Robo-Doctor” AI-based software, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) partner with small-scale and grassroots healthcare providers in remote areas. However, this is only a temporary fix and is unable to address the underlying issue of the lack of access to medical care in these areas. \n\nACTOR: International Governmental Agencies\nHOW: Create new international legal and regulatory measures to address the issue of access to medical care in remote and underfunded areas.\nWHY: In response to the growing crisis, International Governmental Agencies create a series of new legal and regulatory measures to address the issue of access to medical care in remote and underfunded areas. These regulations, which impose penalties on governments and organizations who limit access to medical care, prove to be largely ineffective, as many of these same organizations are able to circumvent the rules.  \n\nACTOR: A multinational tech company\nHOW: Develops a fleet of automated medical drones that are capable of delivering medical care and supplies to remote and underfunded areas.\nWHY: In an effort to address the mounting health crisis, a multinational tech company develops a fleet of automated medical drones that are capable of delivering medical care and supplies to remote and underfunded areas. The drones are equipped with sophisticated AI systems that are able to quickly identify and respond to medical emergencies and provide medical services.\n\nACTOR: National governments\nHOW: Begin implementing policies to heavily subsidize the multinational tech company’s fleet of medical drones in order to increase access to medical care in remote and underfunded areas.\nWHY: In order to increase access to medical care in remote and underfunded areas, national governments begin implementing policies to heavily subsidize the multinational tech company’s fleet of medical drones. These subsidies, however, come at a high cost to governments, as they are forced to divert resources from other critical areas in order to help fund the medical drone program. \n\nACTOR: The global medical community \nHOW: Develops new technologies and protocols to take advantage of the new medical drone system, such as telemedicine and remote medical robot technologies\nWHY: In response to the increased access to medical care in remote and underfunded areas, the global medical community develops new technologies and protocols to take advantage of the medical drone system. These technologies, such as telemedicine and remote medical robot technologies, allow medical professionals to diagnose and treat patients remotely, reducing the need for expensive and time-consuming in-person visits and medical transportation. \n\n\nNARRATIVE:\n-----------------\n"
