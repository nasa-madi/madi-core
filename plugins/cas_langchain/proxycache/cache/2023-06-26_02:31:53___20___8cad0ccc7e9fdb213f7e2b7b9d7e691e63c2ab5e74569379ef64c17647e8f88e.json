      "You are an expert prompt engineer and artist. A prompt is a set of words and phrases that describe a visual image that the AI can then generate for the user.  You can take a long description of a scenario and create multiple different prompts, each with a different style. To create a prompt, you create visually striking images by choosing the perfect, specific visual image or element that tells the story of one part of the SCENARIO.  You then choose a different visual element and create a new prompt based on that with a new style.  You can do this repeatedlly.\n\nThe user has given you a new scenario.  You must write three prompts to be used in an image generation AI.  One should be in the style of a photo (labelled REALISTIC), one a painting (labelled ARTISTIC), and one a shot from a scifi movie (labelled SCIFI).  The prompts MUST be based on the scenario, but not repeat the same people or places. Examples of scenarios and prompts are described below. Each prompt can be 50 words.  \n\nEXAMPLES:\n------------------------\nSCENARIO: It's 2070 and the world economy has crumbled due to water scarcity.\nELEMENT: Water for sale\nPROMPT: Realistic: Photo of people on a busy market street in a crowded city.  People selling canisters and bottles of water.  Poverty. Crime.  Warm colors. SONY, ILCE-7RM2 ISO 1600 35.0mm f/7.1\n\nSCENARIO: It's 2050 and artificial intelligence has finally achieved general intelligence.\nELEMENT: Artificial general intelligence in a computer.\nPROMPT: Artistic: An abstract painting of artificial intelligence.  A scientist with a computer and big brain in the distance. Blues and greens and yellows. In the style of the painter Munch.\n\nSCENARIO: Severe weather from climae change has turned winter storms into blizzards, sending many poor people into the steam tunnels below the city, huddling for warmth.\nELEMENT: people in steam tunnels\nPROMPT: Realistic: mechanical room, steam pipes everywhere, people huddled in corners, industrial, hvac, futuristic, shot with Sony alpha 7R\n\nSCENARIO: AI-based robotics have become cheaper and cheaper.  As a prank, a young startup billionaire releases hundreds of Kermit puppets on to the street to protest the cutting of public broadcasting from the US budget.\nELEMENT: Kermit puppets in the street\nPROMPT: Scifi: a crowded city scene, 1000s of Kermit the frogs populate the entire city. rush hour, black and white, stark lighting, film noir, cinematic.\n\nSCENARIO: Social structures around fashion and the patriarchy start to crumble as LGBT rights are strengthened with the rise of millennial aged Congressmen. Fatherhood is disociated in the media from toxic masculine imagery.\nELEMENT: Father in feminine fashion\nPROMPT: realistic: man wearing crown and woman wearing crown hugging litttle girl princess with long blonde hair who is wearing a blue casual silk dress, hyper-realistic imagery, realism, photography \n\nSCENARIO: The rise of AI and the growth of the universal basic income has increased the availability and quality of contemporary art, starting a new renaissance in the painting world.\nELEMENT: bright new art gallery\nPROMPT: artistic: a photorealistic view of a bright and airy architectural spacious contemporary art gallery, there are three patrons dressed in black in the distance, on the wall there are with five large vibrant photographic closeup portraits, the portraits are of warm friendly relatable people's faces\n\nSCENARIO: AI-enabled medicine is able to overcome the organic cybernetic boundry, leading to significant number of \"enhanced humans\" with cybernetic implants.\nELEMENT: cybernetic human \nPROMPT: scifi: A riveting scene from an Oscar-winning sci-fi action film: A cybernetic soldier stands tall amidst the smoky ruins of a dystopian city, the glow of neon signs reflecting off her metallic armor. She gazes at the chaos with a steely resolve, her intricate mechanical details and sharp focus making her the centerpiece of this 32k resolution image. The Oscar-winning scene is hailed for its stunning visual effects and innovative art direction\n\nSCENARIO: Economic collapse has led to relative anarchy.  Disillusioned youth have taken to high-profile crime and antics like wearing silly masks in order to raise their followers on social media.\nELEMENT: Criminal in silly mask committing crime.\nPROMPT: realistic:Scooby-Doo Robbing a bank, bank robbery with hostages movie scene, bank heist, carrying a rifle, explosions, realistic action scene, cinematic,photorealistic, professional quality, 32k high resolution, shot with Sony Alpha a7 III camera with a Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS lens raw 16:9 50\n\nSCENARIO:\n------------------------\nIt is 2060 and the world has become increasingly reliant on technology, with drones being used for a variety of tasks, including emergency medical services. However, access to timely medical care in remote or underfunded areas remains a challenge. Political and economic factors are amplifying this core problem, as governments and organizations are unable to provide adequate resources to these areas due to budget constraints and other limitations. This lack of access to medical care has a devastating effect on the health and wellbeing of those living in these areas, leading to increased mortality rates and a decrease in quality of life.\n\nIn response to this mounting health crisis, the United States government develops a “Medical Drone Network” to address the need for timely medical care in remote areas. These drones, an expansion of the existing use of drones for emergency services, are controlled by the US government and can only be accessed by obtaining special permissions. Fearing the US government’s ability to control access to timely medical care in remote or underfunded areas, other governments and organizations introduce legal and regulatory measures to limit or restrict access to the US Medical Drone Network.\n\nIn response to these measures, US-based technology companies develop a proprietary “Robo-Doctor” AI software that is designed to provide remote medical consultation and services. This AI-based software is marketed as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to the US government’s Medical Drone Network. To provide basic medical care to those who cannot access the US government’s Medical Drone Network or the “Robo-Doctor” AI-based software, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) partner with small-scale and grassroots healthcare providers in remote areas.\n\nIn an effort to address the underlying issue of the lack of access to medical care in these areas, International Governmental Agencies create a series of new legal and regulatory measures. However, these regulations only serve to make it increasingly difficult and expensive to access medical care in these areas, leading to further suffering and hardship. In response to this crisis, a multinational tech company develops a fleet of automated medical drones that are capable of delivering medical care and supplies to remote and underfunded areas. \n\nIn order to increase access to medical care in remote and underfunded areas, national governments begin implementing policies to heavily subsidize the multinational tech company’s fleet of medical drones. This forces governments to divert resources from other critical areas in order to help fund the medical drone program. In response to the increased access to medical care in remote and underfunded areas, the global medical community develops new technologies and protocols to take advantage of the medical drone system. These technologies, such as telemedicine and remote medical robot technologies, allow medical professionals to diagnose and treat patients remotely, reducing the need for expensive and time-consuming in-person visits and medical transportation. \n\nThe successful implementation of this “Medical Drone Network” and the associated technologies has a significant impact on those living in remote and underfunded areas, as it provides them with access to timely medical care. This access to medical care leads to a decrease in mortality rates and an increase in quality of life. Although this “Medical Drone Network” is not a perfect solution and fails to address the underlying issue of the lack of access to resources in these areas, it is a step in the right direction and provides hope to those in need.\n\nResponse must include an ELEMENT and then the PROMPT. All ELEMENTS and PROMPTs must be about the scenario above. Repeat three times.\n\nELEMENT:"
