      "You are an AI tasked with imagining dystopian futures based on three inputs: an emerging need, an capability or capability gap, and a trend that is changing over time. With the information below rewrite the SEQUENCE of ACTOR, HOW, WHY into a clear narrative.  Use the tone and style of a sci-fi movie summary. Make the narrative at least 4 paragraphs long. Be very specific about actors, their actions, and the subsequent consequences. \n\nINPUTS:\n-----------------\nNeed: Access to healthcare\nTechnology Capability: Autonomous drones\nTrend:  Increasing use of drones in emergency medical services\n\n\n\nFRAMING:\n-----------------\nTimeframe: 2070\nContext: By 2070, the world has become increasingly reliant on autonomous drones for a variety of tasks, including emergency medical services. Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics have enabled drones to autonomously respond to medical emergencies and deliver medical supplies to remote areas.\nCore Problem: Despite the increased use of drones, access to healthcare remains a major challenge in many parts of the world. Inequalities in healthcare access have become more pronounced, with those living in rural and remote areas facing the greatest difficulties.\nCause and Effect: The lack of access to healthcare is caused by a combination of factors, including inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and a lack of trained medical personnel. This has resulted in a widening gap between those who have access to healthcare and those who do not, leading to increased disparities in health outcomes.\nStakeholders: The key stakeholders in this scenario are individuals and communities living in rural and remote areas, who are most affected by the lack of access to healthcare. They are also the most vulnerable to the health risks associated with inadequate healthcare.\nAmplifying Factors: Political and economic factors are amplifying the problem of healthcare access. Governments are failing to invest in healthcare infrastructure and resources, while private companies are exploiting the situation by charging exorbitant prices for medical services.\nCascading Effects: The lack of access to healthcare has far-reaching consequences, impacting individuals, communities, and even entire nations. It has led to increased mortality rates, decreased life expectancy, and a rise in preventable diseases. It has also resulted in a decrease in productivity and economic growth, as well as a decrease in educational attainment.\nInterconnections: The lack of access to healthcare is interconnected with other issues, such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. These issues are further compounded by the lack of access to healthcare, creating a complex web of challenges.\nHuman Impact: The human impact of the lack of access to healthcare is immense. Individuals and communities are struggling to cope with the physical and emotional toll of inadequate healthcare. They are facing difficult decisions about whether to seek medical care or not, and are often forced to make impossible choices between their health and financial security.\n\n\nSEQUENCE:\n-----------------\nACTOR:  The US government \nHOW: Invests heavily in the research and development of autonomous drones for use in emergency medical services.\nWHY: The US government recognizes the need to expand access to healthcare and sees autonomous drones as a cost-effective way to do so. This investment results in the world's most advanced autonomous drones, capable of delivering medical supplies and responding to medical emergencies. \n\nACTOR: Private companies\nHOW: Quickly capitalize on the new technology by marketing autonomous drones as a luxury good.\nHOW: The autonomous drones are marketed as an exclusive way to access medical care, with purchasers paying a premium for the privilege.\nWHY: These marketing tactics make access to care prohibitively expensive for all but the most privileged of individuals. This creates a world in which those with money and power have access to the best healthcare, while those without are left behind. \n\nACTOR: Nation states\nHOW: Begin to restrict the use of autonomous drones by regulating who can and cannot access them. \nWHY: The governments of wealthier nations are using the regulations to restrict access to their own citizens, while preventing poorer nations from using the drones to provide healthcare to their citizens. This creates a two-tiered system, in which those with money and power can access the best healthcare, while those without are increasingly reliant on inadequate and inaccessible healthcare. \n\nACTOR: Poor nations \nHOW: Create a set of healthcare-focused autonomous drones to address the widening healthcare gap. \nWHY: The drones are designed to provide healthcare to remote and rural communities, allowing these communities to access medical care they would not otherwise have access to. However, due to their limited resources and technology, these countries are unable to provide the same quality of care as wealthier nations. This results in a global healthcare system in which poorer nations are reliant on subpar automated drones, while wealthier nations continue to benefit from the most advanced medical technology. \n\nACTOR: Humans \nHOW: Develop a deep mistrust of autonomous drones, treating them as though they are an invading force rather than a healthcare provider. \nWHY: This mistrust is founded in the belief that the drones are a threat to humans' privacy and safety. This causes people to view drones with suspicion and even fear. It also leads to a decrease in the trust placed in healthcare providers and a general reluctance to seek out medical care.\n\nACTOR: AI researchers \nHOW: Develop a new AI-enabled drone system that is designed to create a more collaborative healthcare environment. \nWHY: This new AI-enabled system is designed to foster trust between humans and drones, creating an environment that allows humans and drones to work together more efficiently. However, the AI is unable to accurately predict the complex social interactions of humans, leading to unpredictable and occasionally dangerous outcomes. These flaws in the system cause further mistrust between humans and AI-enabled drones, leading to a decrease in the number of people willing to access medical care. \n\nACTOR: Governments \nHOW: Begin to restrict the use of AI-enabled drones in medical environments in order to protect citizens from the dangers posed by the unpredictable AI. \nWHY: This regulation results in a further decrease in access to healthcare, particularly in poorer nations. It also results in increased mistrust of healthcare providers and systems, leading to a further decline in trust in the healthcare system. \n\nACTOR: Transnational organizations \nHOW: Institute a global system of healthcare provision, with certain countries providing medical care to all citizens, regardless of national boundaries. \nWHY: This system of universal healthcare is designed to address the increasing inequality in healthcare access. However, it does little to address the underlying causes of the gap, such as inadequate resources, lack of infrastructure, and a lack of trained personnel. This leads to a persistent health care gap that is increasingly difficult to bridge, leaving millions of people around the world without access to basic healthcare.\n\n\nNARRATIVE:\n-----------------\n"
