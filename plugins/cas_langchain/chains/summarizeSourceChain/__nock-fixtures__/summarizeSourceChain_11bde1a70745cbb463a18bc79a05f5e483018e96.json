It also outlines the challenges and opportunities associated with the use of drones in emergency medicine.\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used since 1849, and their design and application have modernized dramatically in the last decade. They are now used in a wide range of applications, including health-related applications.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, drones have been used for contactless delivery of PPE, COVID-19 tests, lab samples, and vaccines, as well as for telemedicine and monitoring quarantine orders. The application of drone technology in emergency medicine is promising for rapid delivery of medical equipment and medicines, as well as for quick assessment and timely emergency response.\n\nEMS is a core component of the emergency medical and trauma care system, responding to and transporting millions of Americans every year. Prolonged EMS response and scene times are associated with worse outcomes in patients with significant traumatic injury and shock. Changes in the US healthcare system have further complicated timely EMS response and patient outcomes, including trauma center closures, particularly in rural areas. EMS is consistently seeking new and better ways to safely decrease response times and improve patient outcomes, and drones have emerged as a particularly promising innovation.\n\nApproximately 350,000 individuals have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the US each year, with survival at around only 10%. Recent mathematical modeling studies suggest that drones are capable of delivering AEDs rapidly and reliably to a bystander while awaiting EMS arrival, potentially reducing the 90th percentile of AED arrival times by over six and ten minutes in urban and rural areas, respectively.\n\nThree studies have been conducted to compare the time-saving potential of drone-delivered AEDs to traditional EMS response times for OHCA events. In all three studies, drone-AED delivery times were shorter than historical EMS arrival times, with a median time savings of more than 16 minutes. In 2021, Schierbeck et al delivered AEDs by drone to a series of 12 real-life suspected OCHAs, with a mean time savings of 1:52 minutes.\n\nUncontrolled hemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable death in trauma, and timely transfusion of blood has been shown to improve survival. Studies have demonstrated the feasibility of rapid and reliable drone-transport of blood products while maintaining appropriate storage temperature. In Rwanda, Ghana, and the US, the feasibility of drone-delivery of blood and blood products is being assessed.\n\nThis source discusses the potential for drones to deliver rescue medications, such as naloxone, epinephrine, antiepileptics, and insulin, to areas with long response times or to individuals in need of emergency medication.\n\nDrones are being used to assist with search and rescue operations in remote and coastal areas, as well as in mountainous, heavy snow, and avalanche areas. Deep learning and human gesture recognition are being used to improve the accuracy and reliability of drone-assisted SAR operations.\n\nIn coastal areas, drones can be used to rapidly locate potential drowning victims and deliver floatation devices, which can improve the quality and speed of first aid while keeping lifeguards away from dangerous sea conditions. In simulation studies, drones have been found to save time in locating drowning victims and to effectively identify submerged drowning victims in open water.\n\nDrones are used as critical tools in disaster response and management, providing emergency surveillance, telecommunication services, SAR operations, and delivery of emergency supplies and aid. Examples of this include Haiti and Taiwan after earthquakes, the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan, and Nepal due to frequent floods, landslides, and avalanches. Plans to deliver supplies to Ocracoke Island in the US are being tested for hurricane response scenarios, and drones have the potential to be particularly valuable tools for disaster management in remote areas such as the Canadian arctic.\n\nA mass casualty incident (MCI) is any incident that overwhelms available resources. Drones can be used to augment the response by providing direct visual supervision, assisting with operations and logistics, and providing faster triaging of patients. Drones can also be used to direct crowds and provide direction for mass decontamination in CBRN disasters.\n\nBhatt et al's study demonstrated that drones may be a feasible and cost-effective mechanism for providing emergency telecommunication and telemedicine with patients with otherwise limited or delayed access due to distance, geography, or infrastructure. Drones are even being tested for use as communication hotspots for surgeons to conduct emergency telesurgery in the battlefield, but this has not yet extended into the civilian realm.\n\nRegulatory authorities such as the FAA and EASA are challenged with keeping pace with rapid advances in drone technology while balancing safety, privacy, public acceptance, and existing aerial traffic. The FAA and EASA are investing in research to model and assess potential risks of medical drones and are developing regulations to ensure these risks are appropriately managed. The FAA requires drones to remain within the operator's line of sight and has created a BVLOS Aviation Rulemaking Committee to help lay a path to more operational approval.\n\nThe use of medical drones requires the capture and transmission of individuals' protected health information (PHI), which raises unique issues related to privacy, confidentiality, and consent. The American and Australian public are skeptical of governmental drones due to privacy concerns, but approve of drones for SAR, climate monitoring, and land management. To address these issues, investigators need to communicate with communities and take steps to protect the privacy and confidentiality of bystanders.\n\nThis source discusses the potential safety hazards of autonomous flights, such as malfunctions, hacking, and crashing, and the need for better integration of drone flight paths into existing FAA and aerial vehicle flight paths. It also mentions the potential for injury from direct impact and the need for safe and secure packaging of payloads. Lastly, it discusses the operational limitations of drones due to weather conditions.\n\nThis source discusses the infrastructure, operation, and maintenance of drones, including the need for a network of drones, pilots, and other necessary infrastructure to ensure constant operational availability. It also mentions the need for communication networks outside of commercial networks, as well as the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of developing an emergency medical drone network.\n\nStudies have been conducted to understand public perception of drones in emergency medical situations, and the results have been generally positive. Additionally, studies have been conducted to understand the comfort level of EMS and hospital systems in interacting with drone technology, and the cost-effectiveness of building and maintaining optimized drone networks has been studied.\n\nThis source discusses the potential applications of medical drones in emergency medicine, as well as the technological and legal advances needed to make these applications feasible. It also mentions the need for research into human-drone interactions and public opinion.\n\nPopulations in remote or rural areas tend to have less access to health-care services, be of older age, and have more comorbidities, which may increase the need for rapid response for conditions such as OHCA or stroke. These populations also tend to have a lower average socioeconomic status, leading to longer EMS times and lower survival rates. Delivery of an AED by drone has the potential to increase access to timely defibrillation and provide two-way communication to assist bystanders deliver lifesaving care to OCHA victims in rural and rural areas.\n\nDrones are a promising technology for improving patient survival, outcomes, and quality of life, particularly in remote or underfunded areas. Research suggests that drones in emergency medicine are feasible, accepted by the public, and have broad application. More research is needed to make this application a reality while navigating a changing regulatory environment, public safety and privacy, and public acceptance.\n\nThis work was supported by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through a grant award.
