Chief among them are\nlimits on the growth of federal discretionary spending over the next two years. Mr. Biden also\nagreed to some new work requirements for certain recipients of food stamps and the Temporary Aid for\nNeedy Families program.</p><p>Both sides agreed to modest efforts meant to accelerate the permitting\nof some energy projects — and, in a surprise move, a fast track to construction for a <a\ntarget=\"_blank\"\nhref=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/climate/biden-mountain-valley-pipeline.html\" title>new\nnatural gas pipeline</a> from West Virginia to Virginia that has been championed by Republican\nlawmakers and a key centrist Democrat.</p></div><div><p>Here’s what the legislation would do:</p><h2\nid=\"link-417bde08\">Temporarily suspends the debt limit</h2><p>The deal suspends the nation’s $31.4\ntrillion borrowing limit until Jan. 2025. Suspending the debt limit for a period of time is\ndifferent than setting it at a new fixed level. It essentially gives the Treasury Department the\nlatitude to borrow as much money as it needs to pay the nation’s bills during that time period, plus\na few months after the limit is reached, as the department employs accounting maneuvers to keep up\npayments.</p><p>That’s different than the bill passed by House Republicans, which raised the limit\nby $1.5 trillion or through March 2024, whichever came first.</p><p>Under the new legislation, the\ndebt limit will be set at whatever level it has reached when the suspension ends. For political\nreasons, Republicans tend to prefer suspending the debt limit rather than raising it, because it\nallows them to say they did not technically green-light a higher debt limit.</p><p>The suspension\nwill kick the next potential fight over the nation’s debt load to 2025 — past the next presidential\nelection.</p><h2 id=\"link-32725fe8\">Caps and cuts spending</h2><p>The bill cuts so-called nondefense\ndiscretionary, which includes domestic law enforcement, forest management, scientific research and\nmore — for the 2024 fiscal year. It would limit all discretionary spending to 1 percent growth in\n2025, which is effectively a budget cut, because that is projected to be slower than the rate of\ninflation.</p></div>\n\n----------------------------\nSummary:"

This can be an attributed quote in the source or a section of the source itself. If it is a quote, it must be attributed correctly.\nProblem: the problem identified in the source.

This list should ALAWYS be separated by \";\" and not commas.\n\nSOURCE\n----------------------------\n<div><p>The clawback will eat into the tax collection agency’s efforts to crack\ndown on rich tax cheats. It is also a political win for Republicans, who have been outraged by the\nprospect of a beefed up I.R.S. and approved legislation in the House to <a target=\"_blank\"\nhref=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/us/politics/house-republicans-irs-funding.html\"\ntitle>rescind the entire $80 billion</a>.</p><p>Still, because of the leeway that the I.R.S. has\nover how and when it spends the money, the clawback might not affect the agency’s plans in the next\nfew years. Officials said in a background call with reporters that they expected no disruptions\nwhatsoever from the loss of that money in the short term.</p><p>That’s likely because all of the $80\nbillion from the 2022 law was appropriated at once, but the agency planned to spend it over eight\nyears. Officials suggested the I.R.S. might simply pull forward some of the money earmarked for\nlater years, then return to Congress later to ask for more money.</p><h2 id=\"link-974b4bd\">New work\nrequirements for government benefits</h2><p>The legislation would impose new work requirements on\nolder Americans who receive food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and\nwho receive aid from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program.</p><p>The bill imposes new\nwork requirements for food stamps on adults ages 50 to 54 who don’t have children living in their\nhome. Under current law, those work requirements only apply to people age 18 to 49. The age limit\nwill be phased in over three years, beginning in fiscal year 2023. And it includes a technical\nchange to the T.A.N.F. funding formula that could cause some states to divert dollars from the\nprogram.</p></div><div><p>The bill would also exempt veterans, the homeless and people who were\nchildren in foster care from food-stamp work requirements — a move White House officials say will\noffset the program’s new requirements, and leave roughly the same number of Americans eligible for\nnutrition assistance moving forward.</p><p>Still, the inclusion of new work requirements has drawn\noutrage from advocates for safety net assistance, who say it punishes vulnerable adults who are in\nneed of food.</p><p>“The agreement puts hundreds of thousands of older adults aged 50-54 at risk of\nlosing food assistance, including a large number of women,” Sharon Parrott, president of the Center\non Budget and Policy Priorities, <a\nhref=\"https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/debt-ceiling-agreement-reflects-improvements-over-house-bill-harmful-provisions\"\ntitle target=\"_blank\">said in a\nstatement</a>.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span>President\nBiden also agreed to some new work requirements for certain recipients of food\nstamps.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span>Pete Marovich for The New York\nTimes</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><h2 id=\"link-6a9ffeb0\">Permitting\nreform</h2><p>The agreement includes new measures to get energy projects approved more quickly by\ncreating a lead agency to oversee reviews and require that they are completed in one to two\nyears.</p></div>\n\n----------------------------\nSummary:"
