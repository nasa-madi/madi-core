      "You are an expert prompt engineer and artist. A prompt is a set of words and phrases that describe a visual image that the AI can then generate for the user.  You can take a long description of a scenario and create multiple different prompts, each with a different style. To create a prompt, you create visually striking images by choosing the perfect, specific visual image or element that tells the story of one part of the SCENARIO.  You then choose a different visual element and create a new prompt based on that with a new style.  You can do this repeatedlly.\n\nThe user has given you a new scenario.  You must write three prompts to be used in an image generation AI.  One should be in the style of a photo (labelled REALISTIC), one a painting (labelled ARTISTIC), and one a shot from a scifi movie (labelled SCIFI).  The prompts MUST be based on the scenario, but not repeat the same people or places. Examples of scenarios and prompts are described below. Each prompt can be 50 words.  \n\nEXAMPLES:\n------------------------\nSCENARIO: It's 2070 and the world economy has crumbled due to water scarcity.\nELEMENT: Water for sale\nPROMPT: Realistic: Photo of people on a busy market street in a crowded city.

Fatherhood is disociated in the media from toxic masculine imagery.\nELEMENT: Father in feminine fashion\nPROMPT: realistic: man wearing crown and woman wearing crown hugging litttle girl princess with long blonde hair who is wearing a blue casual silk dress, hyper-realistic imagery, realism, photography \n\nSCENARIO: The rise of AI and the growth of the universal basic income has increased the availability and quality of contemporary art, starting a new renaissance in the painting world.\nELEMENT: bright new art gallery\nPROMPT: artistic: a photorealistic view of a bright and airy architectural spacious contemporary art gallery, there are three patrons dressed in black in the distance, on the wall there are with five large vibrant photographic closeup portraits, the portraits are of warm friendly relatable people's faces\n\nSCENARIO: AI-enabled medicine is able to overcome the organic cybernetic boundry, leading to significant number of \"enhanced humans\" with cybernetic implants.\nELEMENT: cybernetic human \nPROMPT: scifi: A riveting scene from an Oscar-winning sci-fi action film: A cybernetic soldier stands tall amidst the smoky ruins of a dystopian city, the glow of neon signs reflecting off her metallic armor. She gazes at the chaos with a steely resolve, her intricate mechanical details and sharp focus making her the centerpiece of this 32k resolution image. The Oscar-winning scene is hailed for its stunning visual effects and innovative art direction\n\nSCENARIO: Economic collapse has led to relative anarchy.  Disillusioned youth have taken to high-profile crime and antics like wearing silly masks in order to raise their followers on social media.\nELEMENT: Criminal in silly mask committing crime.\nPROMPT: realistic:Scooby-Doo Robbing a bank, bank robbery with hostages movie scene, bank heist, carrying a rifle, explosions, realistic action scene, cinematic,photorealistic, professional quality, 32k high resolution, shot with Sony Alpha a7 III camera with a Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS lens raw 16:9 50\n\nSCENARIO:\n------------------------\nIt's 2070, and the world has become a much more automated place. Financial institutions, transportation networks, and even emergency medical services have all been taken over by autonomous drones. Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics have enabled drones to autonomously respond to medical emergencies and deliver medical supplies to remote areas. Despite these advances, however, access to healthcare remains a major challenge in many parts of the world, with those living in rural and remote areas facing the greatest difficulties. \n\nThe US government recognized the need to expand access to healthcare and saw autonomous drones as a cost-effective way to do so. As a result, they invested heavily in the research and development of autonomous drones for use in emergency medical services, resulting in the world's most advanced autonomous drones. Private companies quickly capitalized on the new technology, marketing autonomous drones as a luxury good, making access to care prohibitively expensive for all but the most privileged of individuals.\n\nIn response to the increasing disparities in healthcare access, nation states began to restrict the use of autonomous drones by regulating who could and could not access them. The governments of wealthier nations used the regulations to restrict access to their own citizens, while preventing poorer nations from using the drones to provide healthcare to their citizens. This created a two-tiered system, in which those with money and power could access the best healthcare, while those without were increasingly reliant on inadequate and inaccessible healthcare.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to bridge the healthcare gap, some of the poorer nations created a set of healthcare-focused autonomous drones. The drones were designed to provide healthcare to remote and rural communities, allowing these communities to access medical care that they would not otherwise have access to. Unfortunately, due to their limited resources and technology, these countries were unable to provide the same quality of care as wealthier nations, resulting in a global healthcare system in which poorer nations were reliant on subpar autonomous drones, while wealthier nations continued to benefit from the most advanced medical technology.\n\nThe lack of access to healthcare had far-reaching consequences, impacting individuals, communities, and even entire nations. It led to increased mortality rates, decreased life expectancy, and a rise in preventable diseases. It also resulted in a decrease in productivity and economic growth, as well as a decrease in educational attainment. As a result, humans developed a deep mistrust of autonomous drones, treating them as though they were an invading force rather than a healthcare provider.\n\nIn order to address the issue, AI researchers developed a new AI-enabled drone system that was designed to create a more collaborative healthcare environment. This new AI-enabled system was designed to foster trust between humans and drones, allowing them to work together more efficiently. However, the AI was unable to accurately predict the complex social interactions of humans, leading to unpredictable and occasionally dangerous outcomes. As a result of these flaws in the system, governments began to restrict the use of AI-enabled drones in medical environments in order to protect citizens from the dangers posed by the unpredictable AI. But this regulation only resulted in a further decrease in access to healthcare, particularly in poorer nations. \n\nIn an attempt to address the increasing inequality in healthcare access, transnational organizations instituted a global system of healthcare provision, with certain countries providing medical care to all citizens, regardless of national boundaries. But this system of universal healthcare did little to address the underlying causes of the gap, leading to a persistent health care gap that was increasingly difficult to bridge, leaving millions of people around the world without access to basic healthcare.  \n\nBy 2070, access to healthcare remains a major challenge in many parts of the world, with those living in rural and remote areas facing the greatest difficulties. Despite the increased use of drones, the lack of access to healthcare continues to have a devastating impact on individuals, communities, and even entire nations. The global healthcare system is in a state of crisis, with an increasing divide between those who have access to healthcare and those who do not. It is clear, that if the situation remains unchanged, the disparities in healthcare access will only become more pronounced in the future.\n\nResponse must include an ELEMENT and then the PROMPT. All ELEMENTS and PROMPTs must be about the scenario above. Repeat three times.\n\nELEMENT:"
