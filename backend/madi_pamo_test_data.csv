1117,Four Myths about Carbon Offsets,,Environment_Climate,Air,,Carbon Offsets,"Companies are setting ambitious decarbonization goals, but not all carbon emissions can be easily mitigated, given technological and economic limitations. To reach net-zero goals, many companies may need to purchase offsets, which allow them to balance their hard-to-abate emissions with investments that preserve or restore forests, wetlands, or other natural resources that either remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or prevent new emissions. Buying such offsets helps companies become carbon-neutral while they continue to work to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. For example, a cement producer might invest in preserving large swaths of forest that may have been at risk of being cleared, to compensate for carbon emissions that it hasn't yet removed from its own manufacturing process or supply chain.
","Carbon, Offsets, Market, Removal, Nature, Strategy, Decarbonization",2021-11-24,2021-11-05,2021,Bain & Co.,https://www.bain.com/insights/four-myths-about-carbon-offsets/ ,Joseph Block,"Aviation is a hard-to-abate industry, just like many others (such as steel and cement). Carbon offsets are sure to play a role in the near and long-term to offset emissions while the aircraft of the future are being built.

38,,,Technological,Human_Factors__Systems,Training,,"Under the first phase of the program, the partners — both headquartered near Munich, Germany — will collaborate on creation of a Lilium type rating training course for qualified commercial pilots. The training will leverage technologies including mixed and virtual reality (MR/VR), facilitating worldwide deployment of the course.
As a leading European airline training organization, Lufthansa Aviation Training has extensive experience in developing pilot competencies. Lilium said this will complement its own expertise in the design of its novel aircraft, which is radically different from the helicopters and airplanes flying today. The companies plan to also work together with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and Federal Aviation Administration on relevant certification requirements.",,2020-12-01,2020-12-01,2020,eVTOL,https://evtol.com/news/lilium-lufthansa-pilot-training-partnership/ ,Joseph Block,Lilium continues to push the bounds of what has been achieved from an eVTOL OEM by partnering with Lufthansa on a pilot training program. This initial program will help to guide industry on how OEMs will certify their pilots for operations in the newly designed aircraft. An area ripe for research.
