          climate effects and mitigation | Energy Futures Lab webinar - YouTube3
          solution paths proposed: Cleaner engines for Reducing
          Emissions->reduces contrail formation, SAFs (sustainable aviation
          fuels) for Reducing Emissions – emits H2O so may increase contrail
          formation->limit SAFs by season/weather/time of day, Routing of
          flights (12 % flights responsible for 80% contrails).Other solutions
          (not in this lecture) – formation flight, additivesDoD studies this
          due to stealth need but may look at solutions that are counter
          productive such as emitting a lot more to minimize nucleus size or
          burning much hotter.Abstract: Contrails are line-shaped clouds made up
          of ice crystals that are formed from black carbon particles emitted by
          aircraft engines. They form and persist only in regions of the
          atmosphere that are cold and humid enough. Individual contrails trap
          outgoing longwave radiation and cause a warming effect, but can also
          reflect incoming solar radiation with a cooling component. On
          aggregate, however, the consensus is a net warming effect and its
          annual climate forcing could be equal or higher than the cumulative
          CO2 that is emitted by aviation since its inception. In this
          presentation, we will model the contrail climate forcing in the North
          Atlantic region over 5 years and identify the set of factors that are
          associated with highly warming/cooling contrails. New mitigation ideas
          are then devised based on these findings, including a targeted use of
          sustainable aviation fuels and prioritising mitigation for flights
          with the highest probability of forming strongly warming contrails."

        summary: On the other hand, David Keith tells us that geoengineering could be
          very inexpensive. According to him, it would cost just $10 billion, or
          one ten-thousandth of global GDP, whereas its benefits could be more
          than 1 percent of global GDP—a return one thousand times greater than
          its cost.

        summary: "Quote: A new UCL study has investigated some very unusual technologies
          for manipulating the climate. It concluded that conventional aircraft
          are presently the most reliable option. Solar geoengineering would
          require tiny reflective particles to be launched into the stratosphere
          - which starts at around 20 km up. These aerosols would reflect
          sunlight – cooling the planet, and counteracting global warming.
          Millions of tons would be needed – and getting this much material 20
          km up is a tall order, requiring novel engineering. Planes can fly
          just high enough to work – and their steady, level flight makes it
          easier to spread reflective particles evenly. This crucial advantage
          is not available from most other technologies – and that could be a
          deal breaker for competitor approaches. Only airships share this
          ability to finely-control aerosol injection.Despite the breadth of
          technologies considered, conventional planes still came out well in
          the analysis. However, customising them for such an unusual mission is
          expensive."

        summary: The uptake routes of plastic particles detected in human bloodstream
          are likely to be via mucosal contact (either ingestion or inhalation).
          Dermal uptake of fine particles is unlikely except if the skin is
          damaged (Schneider et al., 2009). Airborne particles between 1 nm and
          20 µm are considered respirable. Ultrafine (<0.1 µm) inhaled particles
          may become absorbed and accumulate in the lung, while most larger
          particles are expected to be coughed up and eventually swallowed, and
          have a second chance of absorption via the gut epithelium

          for manipulating the climate. It concluded that conventional aircraft
          are presently the most reliable option. Solar geoengineering would
          require tiny reflective particles to be launched into the stratosphere
          - which starts at around 20 km up. These aerosols would reflect
          sunlight – cooling the planet, and counteracting global warming.
          Millions of tons would be needed – and getting this much material 20
          km up is a tall order, requiring novel engineering. Planes can fly
          just high enough to work – and their steady, level flight makes it
          easier to spread reflective particles evenly. This crucial advantage
          is not available from most other technologies – and that could be a
          deal breaker for competitor approaches. Only airships share this
          ability to finely-control aerosol injection.Despite the breadth of
          technologies considered, conventional planes still came out well in
          the analysis. However, customising them for such an unusual mission is
          expensive."

          climate by increasing the burden of stratospheric sulfate aerosols.
          Volcanic eruptions produce a layer of sulfate aerosols that stays in
          the stratosphere for a couple of years, whereas geoengineering efforts
          would need to sustain the aerosol layer persistently to counteract
          CO2-induced warming..These differences in the climate response between
          the pulse forcing and sustained forcing clearly show that caution
          should be taken when using climate consequences of volcanic eruptions
          to directly infer climate responses to stratospheric aerosol
          geoengineering.

    summary: Quote Solving global warming is not a difficult technical problem. As
      Stephen Pacala and Robert Socolow detail with their popularwedge model, a
      combination of several specific actions can stabilize the world’s
      greenhouse gas emissions—although I disagree with their proposal to use
      nuclear power as one of their “wedges.” Instead, the crux of addressing
      global warming is political. The U.S. government gives multibillion-dollar
      subsidies to the coal, oil, gas, and nuclear industries, and gives little
      support to alternative energy sources like solar and wind power that could
      contribute to a solution. Similarly, the federal government is squashing
      attempts by states to mandateemissions reductions. If global warming is a
      political problem more than it is a technical problem, it follows that
      wedon’t need geoengineering to solve it.

    summary: "Q: Where do you think the geoengineering technologies are right now
      and how do you see them growing in the next 5to 10 years?A: Well, one
      difficult question at the outset is how one defines geoengineering. And
      you should probably know that’s acontested concept for some people. There
      are two broad genres. There’s solar radiation management and there’scarbon
      dioxide removal that people often put under the rubric of geoengineering.A
      lot of carbon dioxide removal folks don’t want to be under the rubric of
      geoengineering I think primarily becausethey’re afraid of having their
      approaches lumped in with the SRM approaches, which as we can discuss in a
      moment,could have far more serious implications. But assuming that one
      puts them both under the rubric of geoengineering,we can talk about what’s
      out there.So, most of the research that’s occurring, most of the funding
      that’s occurring is occurring on the carbon dioxideremoval side. In the
      United States, there is now in the Biden administration’s funding pipeline
      about $12 billion for acombination of carbon capture and storage which is
      not geoengineering under most classifications and carbondioxide
      removal.And so, the distinction there is carbon capture and storage
      capture CO2 from the flue gas, so from the point ofcombustion, whereas
      carbon dioxide removal removes the CO2 from the atmosphere, okay?But a
      large chunk of that $12 billion funding is for carbon removal and it’s
      mostly in the field of direct air capture butthere’s also funding for
      enhancing sequestration from soils, developing new methodologies for
      measuringafforestation and reforestation, a little bit on enhanced mineral
      weathering, biochar, bioenergy with carbon captureand storage and so
      forth."
