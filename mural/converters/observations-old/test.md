     - **Trend**: Good: solar geoengineering could reduce the effects of climate change quickly, in most places, at low direct cost. Bad: Solar geoengineering would have imperfections and side effects that will make global governance difficult ... plus, it ’s premature to speculate how its climate effects translate to impacts. Ugly: here’s no evidence we can use it to reverse “climate emergencies” after we’ve detected their arrival... effective use of geoengineering (under the circumstances it ’s most needed) could require the same foresight we have not yet employed for emissions abatement

             - **Quote**: As aerosol particles injected into the stratosphere fall to Earth, they may seed cirrus cloud formations in the troposphere. Cirrus clouds affect Earth’s radiative balance of incoming and outgoing heat, although the amplitude and even direction of the effects are not well understood. While evidence exists that some volcanic aerosols form cirrus clouds, the global effect has not been quantified.

 - **41-1667868664111**
    
     - **Quote**: Solving global warming is not a difficult technical problem. As Stephen Pacala and Robert Socolow detail with their popular
        
        wedge model, a combination of several specific actions can stabilize the world’s greenhouse gas emissions—although I disagree with their proposal to use nuclear power as one of their “wedges.” Instead, the crux of addressing global warming is political. The U.S. government gives multibillion-dollar subsidies to the coal, oil, gas, and nuclear industries, and gives little support to alternative energy sources like solar and wind power that could contribute to a solution. Similarly, the federal government is squashing attempts by states to mandate
        
        emissions reductions. If global warming is a political problem more than it is a technical problem, it follows that we
        
        don’t need geoengineering to solve it.

             - **Quote**: Using sea level rise data from Climate Central and airport locations from OpenFlights, we found that 80 airports could be underwater with one meter of sea level rise, which researchers at the UN’s expert climate panel predict is likely to occur by 2100 if emissions aren’t reduced. Even if emissions are curtailed and warming is limited to 2 degrees Celsius, about half a meter of sea level rise is likely by the end of the century, which would flood 44 airports around the world.

             - **Trend**: The uptake routes of plastic particles detected in human bloodstream are likely to be via mucosal contact (either ingestion or inhalation). Dermal uptake of fine particles is unlikely except if the skin is damaged (Schneider et al., 2009). Airborne particles between 1 nm and 20 µm are considered respirable. Ultrafine (<0.1 µm) inhaled particles may become absorbed and accumulate in the lung, while most larger particles are expected to be coughed up and eventually swallowed, and have a second chance of absorption via the gut epithelium

     - **Problem**: Injecting sulfate aerosol into the stratosphere, the most frequently analyzed proposal for solar geoengineering, may reduce some climate risks, but it would also entail new risks, including ozone loss and heating of the lower tropical stratosphere, which, in turn, would increase water vapor concentration causing additional ozone loss and surface warming

     - **Takeaway**: We simulate the climate impact of a volcanic-like pulse and a geoengineering-like sustained stratospheric sulfate aerosol forcing.  Different timescales of aerosol forcing related to volcanic eruptions and geoengineering would produce quite different climate outcomes. In other words, volcanos are different than aerosols in climate impact.

         - **671-1667868664112**
            
             - **Solution**: Major volcanic eruptions are considered as natural analogues for stratospheric sulfate aerosol geoengineering that aims to cool the climate by increasing the burden of stratospheric sulfate aerosols. Volcanic eruptions produce a layer of sulfate aerosols that stays in the stratosphere for a couple of years, whereas geoengineering efforts would need to sustain the aerosol layer persistently to counteract CO2-induced warming..These differences in the climate response between the pulse forcing and sustained forcing clearly show that caution should be taken when using climate consequences of volcanic eruptions to directly infer climate responses to stratospheric aerosol geoengineering.

"For comparison, current levels of emissions are around 40 billion tonnes of CO2 a year. So 1.5°C means not just zeroing out those 40 billion tonnes, but working to extract another 10 billion more to be net-negative. This would require scaling up current carbon capture and sequestration efforts a 1000-fold".

For the next four decades or so, when the concentration of anthropogenic ozone depleting substances will still be large enough in the stratosphere to produce this effect, additional aerosols from geoengineering would destroy even more ozone and increase damaging ultraviolet flux to Earth’s surface.

             - **Quote**: A new UCL study has investigated some very unusual technologies for manipulating the climate. It concluded that conventional aircraft are presently the most reliable option.
                
                 
                
                Solar geoengineering would require tiny reflective particles to be launched into the stratosphere - which starts at around 20 km up. These aerosols would reflect sunlight – cooling the planet, and counteracting global warming. Millions of tons would be needed – and getting this much material 20 km up is a tall order, requiring novel engineering.
                
                 
                
                Planes can fly just high enough to work – and their steady, level flight makes it easier to spread reflective particles evenly. This crucial advantage is not available from most other technologies – and that could be a deal breaker for competitor approaches. Only airships share this ability to finely-control aerosol injection.
                
                Despite the breadth of technologies considered, conventional planes still came out well in the analysis. However, customising them for such an unusual mission is expensive.

                     - **Quote**: Studies have suggested that aerosols injected at about 25 km would persist for significantly longer – and therefore this could be a better strategy for solar geoengineering. This altitude, however, is right at the limit of advanced reconnaissance aircraft so getting the material up there in a safe and cost-effective way would be a major technological challenge. Now, a team led by Smith has looked at five different ways of injecting aerosols at 25 km to see if the increased costs could be offset by higher performance. As a result, the team describes this option (re: A/C)  as the “winning concept”, but only marginally.

Ultrafine (<0.1 µm) inhaled particles may become absorbed and accumulate in the lung, while most larger particles are expected to be coughed up and eventually swallowed, and have a second chance of absorption via the gut epithelium

        3 solution paths proposed: Cleaner engines for Reducing Emissions->reduces contrail formation, SAFs (sustainable aviation fuels) for Reducing Emissions – emits H2O so may increase contrail formation->limit SAFs by season/weather/time of day, Routing of flights (12 % flights responsible for 80% contrails).
        
        Other solutions (not in this lecture) – formation flight, additives
        
        DoD studies this due to stealth need but may look at solutions that are counter productive such as emitting a lot more to minimize nucleus size or burning much hotter.
        
        Abstract: Contrails are line-shaped clouds made up of ice crystals that are formed from black carbon particles emitted by aircraft engines. They form and persist only in regions of the atmosphere that are cold and humid enough. Individual contrails trap outgoing longwave radiation and cause a warming effect, but can also reflect incoming solar radiation with a cooling component. On aggregate, however, the consensus is a net warming effect and its annual climate forcing could be equal or higher than the cumulative CO2 that is emitted by aviation since its inception. In this presentation, we will model the contrail climate forcing in the North Atlantic region over 5 years and identify the set of factors that are associated with highly warming/cooling contrails. New mitigation ideas are then devised based on these findings, including a targeted use of sustainable aviation fuels and prioritising mitigation for flights with the highest probability of forming strongly warming contrails.

                     - **Quote**: Studies have suggested that aerosols injected at about 25 km would persist for significantly longer – and therefore this could be a better strategy for solar geoengineering. This altitude, however, is right at the limit of advanced reconnaissance aircraft so getting the material up there in a safe and cost-effective way would be a major technological challenge. Now, a team led by Smith has looked at five different ways of injecting aerosols at 25 km to see if the increased costs could be offset by higher performance. As a result, the team describes this option (re: A/C)  as the “winning concept”, but only marginally.

                Solar geoengineering would require tiny reflective particles to be launched into the stratosphere - which starts at around 20 km up. These aerosols would reflect sunlight – cooling the planet, and counteracting global warming. Millions of tons would be needed – and getting this much material 20 km up is a tall order, requiring novel engineering.
                
                 
                
                Planes can fly just high enough to work – and their steady, level flight makes it easier to spread reflective particles evenly. This crucial advantage is not available from most other technologies – and that could be a deal breaker for competitor approaches. Only airships share this ability to finely-control aerosol injection.
                
                Despite the breadth of technologies considered, conventional planes still came out well in the analysis. However, customising them for such an unusual mission is expensive.

     - **Trend**: Q: Where do you think the geoengineering technologies are right now and how do you see them growing in the next 5
        
        to 10 years?
        
        A: Well, one difficult question at the outset is how one defines geoengineering. And you should probably know that’s a
        
        contested concept for some people. There are two broad genres. There’s solar radiation management and there’s
        
        carbon dioxide removal that people often put under the rubric of geoengineering.
        
        A lot of carbon dioxide removal folks don’t want to be under the rubric of geoengineering I think primarily because
        
        they’re afraid of having their approaches lumped in with the SRM approaches, which as we can discuss in a moment,
        
        could have far more serious implications. But assuming that one puts them both under the rubric of geoengineering,
        
        we can talk about what’s out there.
        
        So, most of the research that’s occurring, most of the funding that’s occurring is occurring on the carbon dioxide
        
        removal side. In the United States, there is now in the Biden administration’s funding pipeline about $12 billion for a
        
        combination of carbon capture and storage which is not geoengineering under most classifications and carbon
        
        dioxide removal.
        
        And so, the distinction there is carbon capture and storage capture CO2 from the flue gas, so from the point of
        
        combustion, whereas carbon dioxide removal removes the CO2 from the atmosphere, okay?
        
        But a large chunk of that $12 billion funding is for carbon removal and it’s mostly in the field of direct air capture but
        
        there’s also funding for enhancing sequestration from soils, developing new methodologies for measuring
        
        afforestation and reforestation, a little bit on enhanced mineral weathering, biochar, bioenergy with carbon capture
        
        and storage and so forth.

             - **Trend**: The uptake routes of plastic particles detected in human bloodstream are likely to be via mucosal contact (either ingestion or inhalation). Dermal uptake of fine particles is unlikely except if the skin is damaged (Schneider et al., 2009). Airborne particles between 1 nm and 20 µm are considered respirable. Ultrafine (<0.1 µm) inhaled particles may become absorbed and accumulate in the lung, while most larger particles are expected to be coughed up and eventually swallowed, and have a second chance of absorption via the gut epithelium

Even if emissions are curtailed and warming is limited to 2 degrees Celsius, about half a meter of sea level rise is likely by the end of the century, which would flood 44 airports around the world.

For the next four decades or so, when the concentration of anthropogenic ozone depleting substances will still be large enough in the stratosphere to produce this effect, additional aerosols from geoengineering would destroy even more ozone and increase damaging ultraviolet flux to Earth’s surface.

             - **Trend**: From 1990 to 2018, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from domestic commercial flights grew about 18 percent. Recent studies estimate that U.S. aircraft emissions will increase substantially in the next 20 years. Moreover, airplanes remain the single largest source of carbon dioxide emissions within the U.S. transportation sector that is not yet subject to federal greenhouse gas regulations.

If global aviation were a country, it would rank as the 20th largest carbon dioxide emitter, and U.S. aircraft emissions are 24 percent of all global aircraft emissions. Absent new policies, global aircraft emissions are projected to triple by 2050.

             - **Trend**: Data Points: Air transport generated 895 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) in 2018. This may sound like a lot, but it is only around 2% of the 42 billion tonnes of CO2 generated by human activities every year. Despite passenger numbers increasing at an average of 5% each year, aviation has managed to limit its emissions growth to around half of that. This is through massive investment in new technology and coordinated action to implement new operating procedures and infrastructural measures.

Even if emissions are curtailed and warming is limited to 2 degrees Celsius, about half a meter of sea level rise is likely by the end of the century, which would flood 44 airports around the world.
