And you should probably know that’s a\ncontested concept for some people. There are two broad genres. There’s solar radiation management and there’s\ncarbon dioxide removal that people often put under the rubric of geoengineering.\nA lot of carbon dioxide removal folks don’t want to be under the rubric of geoengineering I think primarily because\nthey’re afraid of having their approaches lumped in with the SRM approaches, which as we can discuss in a moment,\ncould have far more serious implications. But assuming that one puts them both under the rubric of geoengineering,\nwe can talk about what’s out there.\nSo, most of the research that’s occurring, most of the funding that’s occurring is occurring on the carbon dioxide\nremoval side. In the United States, there is now in the Biden administration’s funding pipeline about $12 billion for a\ncombination of carbon capture and storage which is not geoengineering under most classifications and carbon\ndioxide removal.\nAnd so, the distinction there is carbon capture and storage capture CO2 from the flue gas, so from the point of\ncombustion, whereas carbon dioxide removal removes the CO2 from the atmosphere, okay?\nBut a large chunk of that $12 billion funding is for carbon removal and it’s mostly in the field of direct air capture but\nthere’s also funding for enhancing sequestration from soils, developing new methodologies for measuring\nafforestation and reforestation, a little bit on enhanced mineral weathering, biochar, bioenergy with carbon capture\nand storage and so forth.","madiType":"trend","children":[]},{"sources":["https://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/20Reasons.pdf"],"errors":[],"id":"40-1667868664111","type":"sticky note","text":"Global Climate Change (and by extension) GeoEngineering is more of a Political than Technical Problem","hyperlink":"https://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/20Reasons.pdf","madiType":"takeaway","children":[{"errors":[],"id":"43-1667868664111","type":"sticky note","text":"Incentivize (social, economic) activity & technologies that improve climate change variables.","hyperlink":"https://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/20Reasons.pdf","arrowParent":"40-1667868664111","madiType":"solution","children":[]}]},{"sources":[],"errors":["SOURCE MISSING."],"id":"720-1667868664112","type":"sticky note","text":"Past predictions","madiType":"takeaway","children":[]},{"sources":[],"errors":["SOURCE MISSING."],"id":"45-1667868664111","type":"sticky note","text":"","madiType":"takeaway","children":[{"errors":[],"id":"0-1667868664111","type":"sticky note","text":"","arrowParent":"45-1667868664111","madiType":"solution","children":[]},{"errors":[],"id":"552-1667868664112","type":"sticky note","text":"Actor:","arrowParent":"45-1667868664111","madiType":"actor","children":[]}]},{"sources":[],"errors":["SOURCE MISSING."],"id":"633-1667868664112","type":"sticky note","text":"What are stopping effects (sudden stopping of geoengineering)?","madiType":"takeaway","children":[]},{"sources":[],"errors":["SOURCE MISSING."],"id":"230-1667868664111","type":"sticky note","text":"Need - No 3D look at canopy","madiType":"trend","children":[]},{"sources":[],"errors":["SOURCE MISSING."],"id":"269-1667868664112","type":"sticky note","text":"","madiType":"actor","children":[]},{"sources":[],"errors":["NO MATCHING TYPE","SOURCE MISSING."],"id":"233-1667868664112","type":"sticky note","text":"$20/ton - reforestation - Prescouter IB10","madiType":"none","children":[]},{"sources":["https://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/20Reasons.pdf"],"errors":[],"id":"29-1667868664111","type":"sticky note","text":"GeoEngineering focus on CDR/SRM neglects other impacts such as Ocean Acidification.","hyperlink":"https://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/20Reasons.pdf","madiType":"problem","children":[{"errors":[],"id":"30-1667868664111","type":"sticky note","text":"If humans adopted geoengineering as a solution to global warming, with no restriction on continued carbon emissions, the ocean would continue to become more acidic, because about half of all excess carbon dioxide in the atmo- sphere is removed by ocean uptake.

It concluded that conventional aircraft are presently the most reliable option.\n \nSolar geoengineering would require tiny reflective particles to be launched into the stratosphere - which starts at around 20 km up. These aerosols would reflect sunlight – cooling the planet, and counteracting global warming. Millions of tons would be needed – and getting this much material 20 km up is a tall order, requiring novel engineering.\n \nPlanes can fly just high enough to work – and their steady, level flight makes it easier to spread reflective particles evenly. This crucial advantage is not available from most other technologies – and that could be a deal breaker for competitor approaches. Only airships share this ability to finely-control aerosol injection.\nDespite the breadth of technologies considered, conventional planes still came out well in the analysis.

The U.S. government gives multibillion-dollar subsidies to the coal, oil, gas, and nuclear industries, and gives little support to alternative energy sources like solar and wind power that could contribute to a solution.

They form and persist only in regions of the atmosphere that are cold and humid enough. Individual contrails trap outgoing longwave radiation and cause a warming effect, but can also reflect incoming solar radiation with a cooling component. On aggregate, however, the consensus is a net warming effect and its annual climate forcing could be equal or higher than the cumulative CO2 that is emitted by aviation since its inception. In this presentation, we will model the contrail climate forcing in the North Atlantic region over 5 years and identify the set of factors that are associated with highly warming/cooling contrails. New mitigation ideas are then devised based on these findings, including a targeted use of sustainable aviation fuels and prioritising mitigation for flights with the highest probability of forming strongly warming contrails.","hyperlink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxnB1aWggUc","arrowParent":"96-1667868664111","madiType":"trend","children":[]}]
