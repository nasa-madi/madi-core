Two committee Republicans, Representatives Chip Roy and Ralph Norman, bucked their leadership by opposing the bill.</p><p>That vote underscored the need for Democrats to help pass the measure in the House, which is controlled by Republicans with a narrow 222-213 majority.</p><p>House passage would send the bill to the Senate. The measure needs congressional approval before June 5, when the Treasury Department could run out of funds to pay its debts for the first time in U.S. history.</p><p>If the Treasury Department cannot cover make all its payments, or if it was forced to prioritize payments, that could trigger economic chaos in the U.S. and global economies.</p><p>Biden and McCarthy have predicted they will get enough votes to pass the 99-page bill into law before the June 5 deadline.</p><p>The non-partisan budget scorekeeper for Congress on Tuesday said the legislation would reduce spending from its current projections by $1.5 trillion over 10 years beginning in 2024.</p><p>The Congressional Budget Office also said the measure, if enacted into law, would reduce interest on the public debt by $188 billion.\nAI: TEXT\n\nUser: I want to evaluate an article.\nAI: I'm happy to help with that.

Suspending that cap, which is now set at $31.4 trillion, would allow the government to keep borrowing money and pay its bills on time — as long as Congress passes the agreement before June 5, when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/26/business/yellen-treasury-x-date-us-debt.html\" title>Treasury has said</a> the United States will run out of cash.</p><p>In exchange for suspending the limit, Republicans demanded a range of policy concessions from Mr. Biden. Chief among them are limits on the growth of federal discretionary spending over the next two years. Mr. Biden also agreed to some new work requirements for certain recipients of food stamps and the Temporary Aid for Needy Families program.</p><p>Both sides agreed to modest efforts meant to accelerate the permitting of some energy projects — and, in a surprise move, a fast track to construction for a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/climate/biden-mountain-valley-pipeline.html\" title>new natural gas pipeline</a> from West Virginia to Virginia that has been championed by Republican lawmakers and a key centrist Democrat.</p></div><div><p>Here’s what the legislation would do:</p><h2 id=\"link-417bde08\">Temporarily suspends the debt limit</h2><p>The deal suspends the nation’s $31.4 trillion borrowing limit until Jan. 2025. Suspending the debt limit for a period of time is different than setting it at a new fixed level. It essentially gives the Treasury Department the latitude to borrow as much money as it needs to pay the nation’s bills during that time period, plus a few months after the limit is reached, as the department employs accounting maneuvers to keep up payments.</p><p>That’s different than the bill passed by House Republicans, which raised the limit by $1.5 trillion or through March 2024, whichever came first.</p><p>Under the new legislation, the debt limit will be set at whatever level it has reached when the suspension ends. For political reasons, Republicans tend to prefer suspending the debt limit rather than raising it, because it allows them to say they did not technically green-light a higher debt limit.</p><p>The suspension will kick the next potential fight over the nation’s debt load to 2025 — past the next presidential election.</p><h2 id=\"link-32725fe8\">Caps and cuts spending</h2><p>The bill cuts so-called nondefense discretionary, which includes domestic law enforcement, forest management, scientific research and more — for the 2024 fiscal year. It would limit all discretionary spending to 1 percent growth in 2025, which is effectively a budget cut, because that is projected to be slower than the rate of inflation.</p></div>\"\n\n\nCONCISE SUMMARY:"

Officials said in a background call with reporters that they expected no disruptions whatsoever from the loss of that money in the short term.</p><p>That’s likely because all of the $80 billion from the 2022 law was appropriated at once, but the agency planned to spend it over eight years. Officials suggested the I.R.S. might simply pull forward some of the money earmarked for later years, then return to Congress later to ask for more money.</p><h2 id=\"link-974b4bd\">New work requirements for government benefits</h2><p>The legislation would impose new work requirements on older Americans who receive food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and who receive aid from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program.</p><p>The bill imposes new work requirements for food stamps on adults ages 50 to 54 who don’t have children living in their home. Under current law, those work requirements only apply to people age 18 to 49. The age limit will be phased in over three years, beginning in fiscal year 2023. And it includes a technical change to the T.A.N.F. funding formula that could cause some states to divert dollars from the program.</p></div><div><p>The bill would also exempt veterans, the homeless and people who were children in foster care from food-stamp work requirements — a move White House officials say will offset the program’s new requirements, and leave roughly the same number of Americans eligible for nutrition assistance moving forward.</p><p>Still, the inclusion of new work requirements has drawn outrage from advocates for safety net assistance, who say it punishes vulnerable adults who are in need of food.</p><p>“The agreement puts hundreds of thousands of older adults aged 50-54 at risk of losing food assistance, including a large number of women,” Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/press/statements/debt-ceiling-agreement-reflects-improvements-over-house-bill-harmful-provisions\" title target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a>.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><span>Image</span></p></div><figcaption><span>President Biden also agreed to some new work requirements for certain recipients of food stamps.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span>Pete Marovich for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div><div><h2 id=\"link-6a9ffeb0\">Permitting reform</h2><p>The agreement includes new measures to get energy projects approved more quickly by creating a lead agency to oversee reviews and require that they are completed in one to two years.</p></div>\"\n\n\nCONCISE SUMMARY:"

The legislation would temporarily suspend the debt limit until 2025 and cut discretionary spending for the 2024 fiscal year.\n\n This analysis of the proposed debt limit agreement between the White House and Republicans suggests that it would reduce federal spending by $55 billion next year and $81 billion in 2025, with a total savings of $860 billion over a decade. The agreement would increase military spending to $886 billion next year and $895 billion in 2025, and fund veterans' health care at the levels proposed in President Biden's budget. It would also claw back $1.38 billion from the I.R.S. and repurpose $20 billion from the $80 billion it received through the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n The bill includes a clawback of $80 billion from the IRS, which may not affect the agency's plans in the short term. It also imposes new work requirements for food stamps on adults ages 50 to 54 and includes a technical change to the T.A.N.F. funding formula. Additionally, the agreement includes new measures to get energy projects approved more quickly by creating a lead agency to oversee reviews.\n\n This agreement includes new measures to speed up energy project approvals, and approves the Mountain Valley Pipeline in West Virginia. It also ends the freeze on student loan repayments, and repurposes $30 billion in unspent Covid money. It also sets parameters for the next two years of spending, and threatens to reduce spending if Congress does not pass all 12 regular funding bills by the end of the year, potentially leading to a government shutdown.\n\n This article discusses a debt limit deal that would cut $136 billion in spending from defense and veterans' programs. The agreement includes less reduction in future debt than either side proposed, and does not include tax increases or stricter work requirements. The article is written by Jim Tankersley and Alan Rappeport, two economic policy reporters.\"\n\n\nCONCISE SUMMARY:"
