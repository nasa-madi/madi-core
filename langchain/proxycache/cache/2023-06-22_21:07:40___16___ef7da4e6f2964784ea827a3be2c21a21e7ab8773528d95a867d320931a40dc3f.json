        "text": " 2060\nContext: By 2060, the world has become increasingly digitalized and connected. Advances in technology have enabled the development of safer and healthier digital spaces, but the use of social media has become increasingly pervasive, particularly among adolescents.\n\nCore Problem: The mental health risks associated with social media use have become a major concern for individuals and society as a whole. The constant bombardment of information, the pressure to conform to certain standards, and the prevalence of cyberbullying have all contributed to a rise in mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress.\n\nCause and Effect: The rise of social media has created a culture of comparison and competition, leading to feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. This has been further exacerbated by the lack of regulation and oversight, allowing for the spread of misinformation and hate speech. The effects of this have been far-reaching, leading to a decrease in self-esteem, an increase in mental health issues, and a decrease in overall wellbeing.\n\nStakeholders: The primary stakeholders in this scenario are adolescents, who are particularly vulnerable to the mental health risks associated with social media use. Other stakeholders include parents, educators, healthcare professionals, and policymakers, all of whom have a vested interest in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of adolescents.\n\nAmplifying Factors: The lack of regulation and oversight of social media platforms has been a major factor in exacerbating the problem. Additionally, the prevalence of targeted advertising and the use of algorithms to manipulate user behavior have further contributed to the mental health risks associated with social media use.\n\nCascading Effects: The mental health risks associated with social media use have had a cascading effect on various aspects of society. It has led to a decrease in productivity, an increase in absenteeism, and a decrease in academic performance. It has also had a negative impact on interpersonal relationships, leading to a decrease in trust and an increase in social isolation.\n\nInterconnections: The mental health risks associated with social media use are interconnected with other issues such as cyberbullying, online harassment, and the spread of misinformation. These issues are further compounded by the lack of regulation and oversight, creating a complex web of challenges that are difficult to address.\n\nHuman Impact: The human impact of this scenario is far-reaching. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the mental health risks associated with social media use, leading to feelings of insecurity, anxiety, and depression. This has had a profound effect on their self-esteem and overall wellbeing, as well as their relationships with family and friends. The moral and ethical implications of this situation are also significant, as it raises questions about the responsibility of social media companies to protect the safety and wellbeing of their users.",
