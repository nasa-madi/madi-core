      "You are an AI tasked with imagining dystopian futures based on three inputs: an emerging need, an capability or capability gap, and a trend that is changing over time. You have been given contextual information in the FRAMING section.  Use the FRAMING and INPUTS to explore a dystopian scenario.  The scenario MUST follow the format described in SCENARIO_FORMAT.  HOW and WHY statements should not repeat unless new needs, technologies, trends are identified. Actors can be specific countries or organizations that do not exist today.  Actions should often deploy or invent technology that does not exist today, sometimes with marketing or catchy names. Actions can be absurd, unexpected, or counterintuitive.  Unexpected global events or new technologies (singularity, pandemic, alien contact, flying cars, etc.) are allowed and encouraged as part of WHY statements.  Each repetition of ACTOR, HOW, and WHY should move forward in time. \n\n\nINPUTS:\n-----------------\nNeed: Mental health and well-being of children and adolescents\nTechnology Capability: Safer and healthier digital spaces\nTrend:  Increased use of social media\n\n\n\nFRAMING:\n-----------------\nTimeframe: 2060\nContext: By 2060, the world has become increasingly digitalized and interconnected. Advances in technology have enabled the development of safer and healthier digital spaces, but the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents has become a major concern.\nCore Problem: The core problem is the increasing use of social media by children and adolescents, which has led to a rise in mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Despite the availability of safer and healthier digital spaces, the use of social media has become pervasive and has created a range of negative consequences.\nCause and Effect: The cause of this problem is the increased use of social media, which has been driven by the proliferation of digital devices and the availability of high-speed internet. This has led to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and an increase in online communication, which has had a detrimental effect on the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.\nStakeholders: The key stakeholders in this scenario are children and adolescents, their parents, educators, healthcare professionals, and policy makers.\nAmplifying Factors: The problem is further exacerbated by the lack of awareness and understanding of the risks associated with social media use, as well as the lack of effective regulation and enforcement of existing laws and policies.\nCascading Effects: The problem has had a cascading effect on various aspects of society, including education, healthcare, and interpersonal relationships. It has led to a decrease in academic performance, an increase in mental health issues, and a breakdown in communication between parents and children.\nInterconnections: The core problem is interconnected with other existing issues such as cyberbullying, online harassment, and addiction to digital devices. These issues further complicate the situation and create a complex web of challenges.\nHuman Impact: The human impact of this problem is significant. Children and adolescents are struggling with feelings of isolation, loneliness, and low self-esteem. Parents are struggling to understand and regulate their children’s online activities, while educators and healthcare professionals are struggling to provide adequate support and guidance.\n\n\nSCENARIO_FORMAT:\n-----------------\nACTOR: The specific actor from the framing, like a named country or researchers from a specific field. Wherever possible name the actor instead of using a collective.  For example \"the US government\" instead of \"Governments.\"\nHOW: The action the actor took in this dystopian scenario.\nWHY: The direct and indirect effects of the action on the new actor, other stakeholders, and the world. These effects may be unintended.\n\nACTOR: A different specific actor from the framing, impacted by the previous result\nHOW: The action the new actor took in this dystopian scenario in response to the preceeding WHY. The actor may choose to invent or deploy a new technology that does not exist today.\nWHY: The direct and indirect effects of the new action on the new actor, other stakeholders, and the world. These effects may be unintended.\n\n... this pattern of ACTOR, HOW, WHY should repeat at least 7 times.\n\nSCENARIO:\n-----------------\nACTOR:"

        "text": " The US government\nHOW: Introduces the Mental and Digital Health Protection Law (MDHPL), which strictly regulates the use of social media by children and adolescents. \nWHY: The law prohibits access to certain social media platforms and prohibits any online communication that does not meet certain safety standards. To enforce the law, the US government introduces a digital tracking system which tracks all online activities of  children and adolescents. \n\nACTOR: Global tech giants \nHOW: Develops tailored content filtering devices for children and adolescents, which are designed to filter out any content that is deemed to be potentially harmful. \nHOW: The devices are marketed as a way to protect children’s mental health and are given catchy names such as “The Guardian” and “The Protector” \nWHY: Though the intention is to protect children from online harms, the devices end up curtailing their freedom to explore and discover new ideas and inadvertently creating an echo-chamber for their thoughts and opinions. \n\nACTOR: International organizations \nHOW: Introduces the Digital Education and Awareness Program (DEAP) to educate children and adolescents on the importance of responsible online behavior and digital literacy.\nWHY: Though the intentions are honorable, the program primarily serves to reinforce the existing power structures and societal norms, leading to a lack of real progress in addressing the underlying social and structural issues that contribute to the rise of mental health issues. \n\nACTOR: Education institutions \nHOW: Introduces compulsory mental health courses as part of the curriculum. \nWHY: Though the courses are meant to provide students with the tools needed to cope with mental health issues, the rigid structure of the courses fail to recognize the nuances of mental health and only serve to further stigmatize children and adolescents. \n\nACTOR: Pharmaceutical companies \nHOW: Develops a series of brain-altering drugs that are marketed as the “solution” to mental health issues and are specifically designed for children and adolescents. \nHOW: The drugs are branded with catchy names such as “Moodez” and “Mood-U-Up” and are promoted heavily online and on television.\nWHY: Though the drugs are initially successful in masking the symptoms of mental health issues, they eventually lead to an increase in physical and psychological dependence, creating a whole new set of problems. \n\nACTOR: Researchers \nHOW: Pioneers the use of advanced neural networks to detect and predict mental health issues in children and adolescents. \nHOW: The neural networks are deployed in the digital tracking system introduced by the US government and are used to monitor the online activities of children and adolescents. \nWHY: Though initially well-received, the neural networks lead to an increase in false-positives, as they fail to take into account the complex and nuanced nature of mental health issues, thus resulting in innocent children and adolescents being wrongfully identified as having mental health issues. \n\nACTOR: International organizations \nHOW: Introduces a global mental health index, which ranks countries based on the mental health of their citizens. \nWHY: The index serves to further normalize the notion that mental health and well-being is solely the responsibility of the individual and fails to recognize the importance of social and environmental factors in determining mental health. As a result, countries are further incentivized to focus on implementing short-term solutions, leading to a rise in ineffective policies. \n\nACTOR: Governments and tech companies \nHOW: Introduces a global surveillance system that collects and analyzes data from the digital tracking system introduced by the US government. \nWHY: The system is used to monitor the mental health of citizens and to predict the emergence of new mental health issues. Though the intention is to prevent the spread of mental health issues, the system is abused by governments and tech companies to manipulate public opinion and suppress dissenting voices.",
