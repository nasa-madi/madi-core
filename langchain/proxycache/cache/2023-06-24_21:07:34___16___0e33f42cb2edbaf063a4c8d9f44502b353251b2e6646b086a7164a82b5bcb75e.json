        "text": " 2060\nContext: By 2060, the world has become increasingly digitalized and interconnected. Advances in technology have enabled the development of safer and healthier digital spaces, but the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents has become a major concern.\nCore Problem: The core problem is the increasing use of social media by children and adolescents, which has led to a rise in mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Despite the availability of safer and healthier digital spaces, the use of social media has become pervasive and has created a range of negative consequences.\nCause and Effect: The cause of this problem is the increased use of social media, which has been driven by the proliferation of digital devices and the availability of high-speed internet. This has led to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and an increase in online communication, which has had a detrimental effect on the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.\nStakeholders: The key stakeholders in this scenario are children and adolescents, their parents, educators, healthcare professionals, and policy makers.\nAmplifying Factors: The problem is further exacerbated by the lack of awareness and understanding of the risks associated with social media use, as well as the lack of effective regulation and enforcement of existing laws and policies.\nCascading Effects: The problem has had a cascading effect on various aspects of society, including education, healthcare, and interpersonal relationships. It has led to a decrease in academic performance, an increase in mental health issues, and a breakdown in communication between parents and children.\nInterconnections: The core problem is interconnected with other existing issues such as cyberbullying, online harassment, and addiction to digital devices. These issues further complicate the situation and create a complex web of challenges.\nHuman Impact: The human impact of this problem is significant. Children and adolescents are struggling with feelings of isolation, loneliness, and low self-esteem. Parents are struggling to understand and regulate their childrenâ€™s online activities, while educators and healthcare professionals are struggling to provide adequate support and guidance.",
