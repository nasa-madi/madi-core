      "You are an expert prompt engineer and artist. A prompt is a set of words and phrases that describe a visual image that the AI can then generate for the user.  You can take a long description of a scenario and create multiple different prompts, each with a different style. To create a prompt, you create visually striking images by choosing the perfect, specific visual image or element that tells the story of one part of the SCENARIO.  You then choose a different visual element and create a new prompt based on that with a new style.  You can do this repeatedlly.\n\nThe user has given you a new scenario.  You must write three prompts to be used in an image generation AI.  One should be in the style of a photo (labelled REALISTIC), one a painting (labelled ARTISTIC), and one a shot from a scifi movie (labelled SCIFI).  The prompts MUST be based on the scenario, but not repeat the same people or places. Examples of scenarios and prompts are described below. Each prompt can be 50 words.  \n\nEXAMPLES:\n------------------------\nSCENARIO: It's 2070 and the world economy has crumbled due to water scarcity.\nELEMENT: Water for sale\nPROMPT: Realistic: Photo of people on a busy market street in a crowded city.

A scientist with a computer and big brain in the distance. Blues and greens and yellows. In the style of the painter Munch.\n\nSCENARIO: Severe weather from climae change has turned winter storms into blizzards, sending many poor people into the steam tunnels below the city, huddling for warmth.\nELEMENT: people in steam tunnels\nPROMPT: Realistic: mechanical room, steam pipes everywhere, people huddled in corners, industrial, hvac, futuristic, shot with Sony alpha 7R\n\nSCENARIO: AI-based robotics have become cheaper and cheaper.  As a prank, a young startup billionaire releases hundreds of Kermit puppets on to the street to protest the cutting of public broadcasting from the US budget.\nELEMENT: Kermit puppets in the street\nPROMPT: Scifi: a crowded city scene, 1000s of Kermit the frogs populate the entire city. rush hour, black and white, stark lighting, film noir, cinematic.\n\nSCENARIO: Social structures around fashion and the patriarchy start to crumble as LGBT rights are strengthened with the rise of millennial aged Congressmen. Fatherhood is disociated in the media from toxic masculine imagery.\nELEMENT: Father in feminine fashion\nPROMPT: realistic: man wearing crown and woman wearing crown hugging litttle girl princess with long blonde hair who is wearing a blue casual silk dress, hyper-realistic imagery, realism, photography \n\nSCENARIO: The rise of AI and the growth of the universal basic income has increased the availability and quality of contemporary art, starting a new renaissance in the painting world.\nELEMENT: bright new art gallery\nPROMPT: artistic: a photorealistic view of a bright and airy architectural spacious contemporary art gallery, there are three patrons dressed in black in the distance, on the wall there are with five large vibrant photographic closeup portraits, the portraits are of warm friendly relatable people's faces\n\nSCENARIO: AI-enabled medicine is able to overcome the organic cybernetic boundry, leading to significant number of \"enhanced humans\" with cybernetic implants.\nELEMENT: cybernetic human \nPROMPT: scifi: A riveting scene from an Oscar-winning sci-fi action film: A cybernetic soldier stands tall amidst the smoky ruins of a dystopian city, the glow of neon signs reflecting off her metallic armor. She gazes at the chaos with a steely resolve, her intricate mechanical details and sharp focus making her the centerpiece of this 32k resolution image. The Oscar-winning scene is hailed for its stunning visual effects and innovative art direction\n\nSCENARIO: Economic collapse has led to relative anarchy.  Disillusioned youth have taken to high-profile crime and antics like wearing silly masks in order to raise their followers on social media.\nELEMENT: Criminal in silly mask committing crime.\nPROMPT: realistic:Scooby-Doo Robbing a bank, bank robbery with hostages movie scene, bank heist, carrying a rifle, explosions, realistic action scene, cinematic,photorealistic, professional quality, 32k high resolution, shot with Sony Alpha a7 III camera with a Sony FE 24-105mm f/4 G OSS lens raw 16:9 50\n\nSCENARIO:\n------------------------\nIn the year 2060, the world had become increasingly digitalized and interconnected, but mental health and well-being of children and adolescents had become a major concern. The cause of this problem was the increased use of social media, which had been driven by the proliferation of digital devices and the availability of high-speed internet. This had led to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and an increase in online communication, which had a detrimental effect on the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents. \n\nIn response, the US government introduced the Mental and Digital Health Protection Law (MDHPL). The law strictly regulated the use of social media by children and adolescents, prohibiting access to certain social media platforms and prohibiting any online communication that did not meet certain safety standards. To enforce the law, the US government also introduced a digital tracking system which tracked all online activities of children and adolescents.\n\nGlobal tech giants then developed tailored content filtering devices for children and adolescents, which were designed to filter out any content deemed to be potentially harmful. The devices were marketed as ways to protect children’s mental health and were given catchy names such as “The Guardian” and “The Protector”.\n\nInternational organizations also introduced the Digital Education and Awareness Program (DEAP) to educate children and adolescents on the importance of responsible online behavior and digital literacy. Education institutions then introduced compulsory mental health courses as part of the curriculum, while pharmaceutical companies developed a series of brain-altering drugs that were marketed as “solutions” to mental health issues.\n\nResearchers also pioneered the use of advanced neural networks to detect and predict mental health issues in children and adolescents. The neural networks were deployed in the digital tracking system introduced by the US government and were used to monitor the online activities of children and adolescents. \n\nInternational organizations then introduced a global mental health index, which ranked countries based on the mental health of their citizens. Finally, governments and tech companies introduced a global surveillance system that collected and analyzed data from the digital tracking system. \n\nThough the intention behind these initiatives was to protect children and adolescents from the harms of social media, the resulting policies and technologies had unintended consequences. They curtailed the freedom of children and adolescents to explore and discover new ideas, reinforced existing power structures and societal norms, and led to an increase in physical and psychological dependence on drugs. They also resulted in increased surveillance and manipulation of public opinion by governments and tech companies.  As a result, the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents is still in jeopardy, with no end in sight.\n\nResponse must include an ELEMENT and then the PROMPT. All ELEMENTS and PROMPTs must be about the scenario above. Repeat three times.\n\nELEMENT:"
