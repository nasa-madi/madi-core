        "text": " The year is 2040.\nContext: In the years leading up to 2040, the world has seen rapid advances in technology, with the internet and social media becoming increasingly pervasive. This has enabled people to stay connected and share information more easily, but it has also created a new set of challenges, particularly for children and adolescents.\nCore Problem: The mental health and well-being of children and adolescents is increasingly at risk due to the lack of safer and healthier digital spaces. The increased use of social media by adolescents has led to a rise in cyberbullying, online harassment, and other forms of digital abuse.\nCause and Effect: The lack of adequate safeguards and regulations has enabled online predators to target vulnerable children and adolescents. This has resulted in a range of negative psychological and emotional effects, including depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.\nStakeholders: The key stakeholders in this scenario include children and adolescents, their parents and guardians, educators, mental health professionals, and policy makers.\nAmplifying Factors: The lack of awareness and education about the risks of social media has made it difficult for parents and guardians to protect their children from online predators. Additionally, the lack of effective regulation and enforcement has enabled online predators to continue to target vulnerable children and adolescents.\nCascading Effects: The negative psychological and emotional effects of cyberbullying and online harassment have had a cascading effect on other aspects of society. It has led to a decrease in academic performance, an increase in mental health issues, and a decrease in overall well-being.\nInterconnections: The core problem is interconnected with other issues such as poverty, inequality, and lack of access to mental health services. These issues further complicate the situation and make it more difficult to address the core problem.\nHuman Impact: The human impact of this scenario is immense. Children and adolescents are facing a range of psychological and emotional challenges due to cyberbullying and online harassment. They are struggling with feelings of isolation, fear, and helplessness, and are often unable to find the support they need to cope with these issues.",
