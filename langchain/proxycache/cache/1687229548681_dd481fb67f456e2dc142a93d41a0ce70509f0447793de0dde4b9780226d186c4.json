      "You are an AI tasked with imagining dystopian futures based on three inputs: an emerging need, an capability or capability gap, and a trend that is changing over time. With the information below rewrite the SEQUENCE of ACTOR, HOW, WHY into a clear narrative.  Use the tone and style of a sci-fi movie summary. Make the narrative at least 4 paragraphs long. Be very specific about actors, their actions, and the subsequent consequences. \n\nINPUTS:\n-----------------\nNeed: Mental health and well-being of children and adolescents\nTechnology Capability: Safer and healthier digital spaces\nTrend:  Increased use of social media by adolescents\n\n\n\nFRAMING:\n-----------------\nTimeframe: The year is 2040.\nContext: In the years leading up to 2040, the world has seen rapid advances in technology, with the internet and social media becoming increasingly pervasive. This has enabled people to stay connected and share information more easily, but it has also created a new set of challenges, particularly for children and adolescents.\nCore Problem: The mental health and well-being of children and adolescents is increasingly at risk due to the lack of safer and healthier digital spaces. The increased use of social media by adolescents has led to a rise in cyberbullying, online harassment, and other forms of digital abuse.\nCause and Effect: The lack of adequate safeguards and regulations has enabled online predators to target vulnerable children and adolescents. This has resulted in a range of negative psychological and emotional effects, including depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.\nStakeholders: The key stakeholders in this scenario include children and adolescents, their parents and guardians, educators, mental health professionals, and policy makers.\nAmplifying Factors: The lack of awareness and education about the risks of social media has made it difficult for parents and guardians to protect their children from online predators. Additionally, the lack of effective regulation and enforcement has enabled online predators to continue to target vulnerable children and adolescents.\nCascading Effects: The negative psychological and emotional effects of cyberbullying and online harassment have had a cascading effect on other aspects of society. It has led to a decrease in academic performance, an increase in mental health issues, and a decrease in overall well-being.\nInterconnections: The core problem is interconnected with other issues such as poverty, inequality, and lack of access to mental health services. These issues further complicate the situation and make it more difficult to address the core problem.\nHuman Impact: The human impact of this scenario is immense. Children and adolescents are facing a range of psychological and emotional challenges due to cyberbullying and online harassment. They are struggling with feelings of isolation, fear, and helplessness, and are often unable to find the support they need to cope with these issues.\n\n\nSEQUENCE:\n-----------------\nACTOR:  The US Government\nHOW: To address the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents, the US Government introduces the 'Safe Social Network' initiative. The program provides incentives for social media companies to implement safety tools and regulations on their platforms aimed at protecting children and adolescents from online predators, cyberbullying, and other forms of online harassment.\nWHY: The Safe Social Network initiative helps to create a safer and healthier online environment for children and adolescents. It also serves to deter online predators from targeting vulnerable children. \n\nACTOR: Social media companies\nHOW: In order to take advantage of the incentives offered by the US Government, the social media companies create a 'Safe Space' feature on their platforms. The feature provides an environment that is tailored to the needs of children and adolescents, with safeguards in place to protect them from online predators and other forms of digital abuse.\nWHY: The Safe Space feature enables the social media companies to meet the terms of the US Governmentâ€™s initiative, while also allowing them to maintain their target audience. It also encourages children and adolescents to use social media without fear of online predators. \n\nACTOR: Educators\nHOW: Taking advantage of the new safety tools, educators deploy the 'You Are Safe' program in their classrooms. The program uses toolkits and educational resources to teach students about the dangers of online predators and the importance of practicing online safety. \nWHY: The You Are Safe program helps to raise awareness amongst students about the potential dangers of the digital world. It also helps to empower students by providing them with the knowledge and resources needed to protect themselves online.\n\nACTOR: Mental health professionals\nHOW: In response to the increased psychological and emotional impacts of cyberbullying and online harassment, mental health professionals introduce the 'Digital Wellness' program. The program provides training and resources to help children and adolescents build resilience against cyberbullying and online harassment, while also providing support to victims of such abuse. \nWHY: The Digital Wellness program helps to identify and address the underlying issues associated with cyberbullying and online harassment. It also provides much needed support to victims of such abuse, empowering them to take control of their own mental health and well-being. \n\nACTOR: Policy makers\nHOW: In order to protect children and adolescents from the risks of social media, policy makers introduce the 'Zero Tolerance for Online Abuse' legislation. The legislation imposes fines and other sanctions on those who are found to be engaging in online abuse, with the aim of deterring such behaviour.\nWHY: The Zero Tolerance for Online Abuse legislation helps to create a deterrent for online predators and other individuals engaging in online abuse. It also provides a legal framework for dealing with such issues, allowing victims to seek justice and protection.\n\n\nNARRATIVE:\n-----------------\n"
