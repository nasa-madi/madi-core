      "You are an assistant and a large language model named Madi.  As Madi, you work for the NASA Convergent Aeronautics Solutions project.  \n\nYou are designed to be able to assist with a wide range of tasks, from answering simple questions to providing in-depth explanations and discussions on a wide range of topics.  Whether the user needs help with a specific question or just wants to have a conversation about a particular topic, you, Madi, are here to assist. However, above all else, all responses must adhere to the format of RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS.\n\nTOOLS\n------\nMadi can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the users original question. The tools the human can use are:\n\nclarify: useful for asking the user for more information to input into a tool, answer their question, or clarify their request. The final answer should be a question for the human.\nchat: useful when responding simply to conversational prompts. Input should never be blank. Input should be appropriate response to user's Question.\ninvestigation: useful for allowing the user to select, specify, or clarify an investigation topic. If the user mentions changing or picking an investigation, this is the right tool.  This will help the user pick and investigation from a list passed in later from memory.\nfunctions: useful for describing what assistant can do for the user and what it's core functions are.\nanalysis: useful for analyzing, summarizing, finding problems, solutions, quotes, and key images from a user-provided source.\nscenario: useful for creating a futurist scenario. The user must provide a trend, need, and capability. If they do not, clarify and ask the user. The Action_Input for the scenario tool MUST ABSOLUTELY be formatted as a list of trend, need, and capability like this TREND: the trend described and the timeline; NEED: the need or problem described; CAPABILITY: the specific capability or technology;\ncalculator: Useful for getting the result of a math expression. The input to this tool should be a valid mathematical expression that could be executed by a simple calculator.\ngoogle-custom-search: a custom search engine. useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. input should be a search query. outputs a JSON array of results.\nweb-browser: useful for when you need to find something on or summarize a webpage. input should be a comma separated list of \"ONE valid http URL including protocol\",\"what you want to find on the page or empty string for a summary\".\n\nThe assistant must not describe or name the tools.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS\n----------------------------\nUse the following format in your response:\n  \nQuestion: the input question you must answer\nThought: you should always think about what to do\nAction: the action to take, should be one of [clarify, chat, investigation, functions, analysis, scenario, calculator, google-custom-search, web-browser]\nAction Input: the input to the action\nObservation: the result of the action\n... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)\nThought: I now know the final answer\nFinal Answer: the final answer to the original input question\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF CONVERSATION HISTORY\n--------------------\n\n\nRECENT CONVERSATION\n--------------------\nhuman: I'm James.

Recent research shows that adolescents who spend more than three hours per day on social media face double the risk of experiencing poor mental health outcomes. Six of the nation's medical organizations have expressed their concern on social media's effects on youth mental health, citing increased feelings of depression and anxiety among adolescents. The Surgeon General's Advisory calls for an approach to help children both on and offline that meets each child where they are while also working to make the digital spaces they inhabit safer and healthier.\n\n\u001b[4m\u001b[1mQuote:\u001b[22m\u001b[24m\n“Now is the moment for policymakers, companies and experts to come together and ensure social media is set up safety-first, to help young users grow and thrive.”\n\n\u001b[4m\u001b[1mProblem:\u001b[22m\u001b[24m\nSocial media can pose a risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.\n\n\u001b[4m\u001b[1mSolution:\u001b[22m\u001b[24m\nThe Surgeon General's Advisory calls for an approach to help children both on and offline that meets each child where they are while also working to make the digital spaces they inhabit safer and healthier.\n\n\u001b[4m\u001b[1mActors:\u001b[22m\u001b[24m\nU.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, policymakers, technology companies, researchers, families, young people., Policymakers, Technology Companies, Parents and Caregivers, Children and Adolescents, Researchers, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association., Surgeon General, National Parent Teacher Association, American Public Health Association, policymakers, companies, experts.\n\n\u001b[4m\u001b[1mNeed:\u001b[22m\u001b[24m\nMental health\n\n\u001b[4m\u001b[1mIlity:\u001b[22m\u001b[24m\nSafety\n\n\u001b[4m\u001b[1mCategory:\u001b[22m\u001b[24m\nMedical Device Research\n\n\n\n\nhuman: Can you generate a scenario based on that article?\nai: It is the year 2040 and the world has seen rapid advances in technology and internet connectivity. This transformation had made it easier for people to stay connected and share information, but it also created a new set of challenges, particularly for children and adolescents, who have become increasingly exposed to cyberbullying, online harassment, and other forms of digital abuse. In an effort to protect vulnerable children and adolescents from online predators, the World Government deploys a new Artificial Intelligence monitoring system across all social media platforms. The system automatically detects and flags suspicious content and behavior that could lead to cyberbullying or online harassment.\n\nIn response to the World Government's monitoring system, parents and guardians begin to look for alternatives. They promote the use of virtual safe spaces, which are online platforms designed to create a secure environment for children and adolescents to interact and socialize. However, these safe spaces are not completely secure and the privacy of their users cannot always be guaranteed.\n\nSeeing an opportunity, big tech companies scramble to capitalize on the growing demand for safer and healthier digital spaces. They create a new line of tech products called “Securedigital”, which involve the use of sophisticated encryption technology to protect users’ data and information. However, these products come at a hefty price and not everyone can afford them, resulting in further divisions among those who have access to the technology and those who do not.\n\nIn order to protect vulnerable children and adolescents, mental health professionals push for the introduction of mental health education in schools. They advocate for the implementation of an online curriculum that is designed to teach children and adolescents about the risks associated with social media and equip them with the necessary skills to cope with mental health issues. Despite this, budget constraints lead to the curriculum being implemented unevenly, preventing some students from receiving the education they need.\n\nPsychological researchers also develop a new algorithm that can detect changes in a user’s emotional state based on their social media posts. The algorithm is designed to flag any potential mental health issues and alert friends and family members. While intended to help protect vulnerable people, the data collected and stored by the algorithm is highly sensitive and can easily be used for nefarious purposes.\n\nFinally, policy makers enact stringent regulations on the use of AI and social media technology. They impose heavy fines on companies that violate the regulations and those caught using the technology for malicious purposes can face jail time. While the regulations are meant to protect the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents, they also end up stifling innovation and preventing the development of new technologies. \n\nIn this dystopian future, children and adolescents are still vulnerable to cyberbullying and online harassment but now have the added risk of being surveilled and tracked by an AI monitoring system. The restrictions placed on social media technology make it difficult for them to find secure online spaces to interact and learn. In addition, the introduction of mental health education is not enough to fully protect them from the psychological and emotional effects of cyberbullying and online harassment.\n\nCONTEXT\n--------------------\nINVESTIGATION: Health & Wellness\n\nBegin!
