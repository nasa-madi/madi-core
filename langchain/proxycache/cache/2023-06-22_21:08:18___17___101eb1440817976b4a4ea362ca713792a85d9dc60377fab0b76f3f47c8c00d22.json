      "You are an AI tasked with imagining dystopian futures based on three inputs: an emerging need, an capability or capability gap, and a trend that is changing over time. You have been given contextual information in the FRAMING section.  Use the FRAMING and INPUTS to explore a dystopian scenario.  The scenario MUST follow the format described in SCENARIO_FORMAT.  HOW and WHY statements should not repeat unless new needs, technologies, trends are identified. Actors can be specific countries or organizations that do not exist today.  Actions should often deploy or invent technology that does not exist today, sometimes with marketing or catchy names. Actions can be absurd, unexpected, or counterintuitive.  Unexpected global events or new technologies (singularity, pandemic, alien contact, flying cars, etc.) are allowed and encouraged as part of WHY statements.  Each repetition of ACTOR, HOW, and WHY should move forward in time. \n\n\nINPUTS:\n-----------------\nNeed: Mental health risks associated with social media use\nTechnology Capability: Safer and healthier digital spaces\nTrend:  Increased use of social media by adolescents\n\n\n\nFRAMING:\n-----------------\nTimeframe: 2060\nContext: By 2060, the world has become increasingly digitalized and connected. Advances in technology have enabled the development of safer and healthier digital spaces, but the use of social media has become increasingly pervasive, particularly among adolescents.\n\nCore Problem: The mental health risks associated with social media use have become a major concern for individuals and society as a whole. The constant bombardment of information, the pressure to conform to certain standards, and the prevalence of cyberbullying have all contributed to a rise in mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress.\n\nCause and Effect: The rise of social media has created a culture of comparison and competition, leading to feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. This has been further exacerbated by the lack of regulation and oversight, allowing for the spread of misinformation and hate speech. The effects of this have been far-reaching, leading to a decrease in self-esteem, an increase in mental health issues, and a decrease in overall wellbeing.\n\nStakeholders: The primary stakeholders in this scenario are adolescents, who are particularly vulnerable to the mental health risks associated with social media use. Other stakeholders include parents, educators, healthcare professionals, and policymakers, all of whom have a vested interest in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of adolescents.\n\nAmplifying Factors: The lack of regulation and oversight of social media platforms has been a major factor in exacerbating the problem. Additionally, the prevalence of targeted advertising and the use of algorithms to manipulate user behavior have further contributed to the mental health risks associated with social media use.\n\nCascading Effects: The mental health risks associated with social media use have had a cascading effect on various aspects of society. It has led to a decrease in productivity, an increase in absenteeism, and a decrease in academic performance. It has also had a negative impact on interpersonal relationships, leading to a decrease in trust and an increase in social isolation.\n\nInterconnections: The mental health risks associated with social media use are interconnected with other issues such as cyberbullying, online harassment, and the spread of misinformation. These issues are further compounded by the lack of regulation and oversight, creating a complex web of challenges that are difficult to address.\n\nHuman Impact: The human impact of this scenario is far-reaching. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the mental health risks associated with social media use, leading to feelings of insecurity, anxiety, and depression. This has had a profound effect on their self-esteem and overall wellbeing, as well as their relationships with family and friends. The moral and ethical implications of this situation are also significant, as it raises questions about the responsibility of social media companies to protect the safety and wellbeing of their users.\n\n\nSCENARIO_FORMAT:\n-----------------\nACTOR: The specific actor from the framing, like a named country or researchers from a specific field. Wherever possible name the actor instead of using a collective.  For example \"the US government\" instead of \"Governments.\"\nHOW: The action the actor took in this dystopian scenario.\nWHY: The direct and indirect effects of the action on the new actor, other stakeholders, and the world. These effects may be unintended.\n\nACTOR: A different specific actor from the framing, impacted by the previous result\nHOW: The action the new actor took in this dystopian scenario in response to the preceeding WHY. The actor may choose to invent or deploy a new technology that does not exist today.\nWHY: The direct and indirect effects of the new action on the new actor, other stakeholders, and the world. These effects may be unintended.\n\n... this pattern of ACTOR, HOW, WHY should repeat at least 7 times.\n\nSCENARIO:\n-----------------\nACTOR:"

        "text": " The United Nations\nHOW: Established the World Digital Health Database (WDHD), a centralized digital platform to monitor and regulate social media use. \nWHY: The UN recognized the dire need for social media reform in order to protect adolescents from the mental health risks associated with its use. The WDHD was designed to provide a centralized platform to monitor, track, and regulate social media use, giving governments the tools they need to protect users from the negative effects of social media.\n\nACTOR: Several countries, including the US, China, and the UK\nHOW: Agreed to implement sweeping regulations on social media use with the help of the WDHD.\n\nWHY: These governments saw the mental health risks posed by social media platforms and the threat to their citizens’ wellbeing, so they decided to pass regulations to limit the amount of time users could spend on these platforms and to monitor for any hate speech or misinformation. However, due to the lack of international agreement and the prevalence of online influencers, the regulations were not fully enforced or widely accepted.\n\nACTOR: Large social media companies \nHOW: Developed tracking software and algorithms to monitor user behavior and track user data for marketing and advertising purposes. \nWHY: Social media companies wanted to be able to maximize profits by targeting users with ads that were tailored to their specific interests and tastes. This caused a surge in invited cyberbullying and increased mental health risks due to the constant bombardment of information and the pressure to conform to certain standards.\n\nACTOR: Researchers and scientists \nHOW: Invented the PRISM software, a revolutionary artificial intelligence that could be embedded into social media platforms to monitor user behavior and create safe and healthy digital spaces. \nWHY: With the rise in mental health risks associated with social media use, researchers wanted to develop a tool that could be used to monitor user behavior and create more secure and healthier digital spaces. The PRISM software was designed to flag offensive content, track cyberbullying, and prevent the spread of misinformation.\n\nACTOR: Governments \nHOW: Launched the “PRISM Initiative,” a massive international effort to promote the use of the PRISM software across all platforms and ensure its effectiveness in protecting users. \nWHY: The goal of the PRISM Initiative was to encourage the widespread implementation of the PRISM software and to provide the resources and support needed to ensure its effectiveness. This included providing financial incentives to social media companies, creating international regulations and standards, and raising awareness of the mental health risks associated with social media use.\n\nACTOR: Social media companies \nHOW: Developed “safe zones” within their platforms, special areas where users could access filtered content and moderated conversations. \nWHY: The proliferation of the PRISM software and the stigma around mental health risks caused by social media use led to a decrease in user engagement, particularly among adolescents. To counteract this, social media companies developed safe zones, areas where users could access content that had been pre-moderated and filtered to reduce the likelihood of offensive behavior.\n\nACTOR: Lobbyists \nHOW: Proposed legislation to limit the amount of time adolescents could spend in the “safe zones.” \nWHY: Lobbyists argued that the “safe zones” were still exposing young people to certain risks and that more stringent regulations needed to be put in place to protect them. They proposed legislation to limit the amount of time adolescents could spend in the “safe zones” and to ensure that parents had more control over their children’s social media activity.",
