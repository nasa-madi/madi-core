Recent research shows that adolescents who spend more than three hours per day on social media face double the risk of experiencing poor mental health outcomes. Six of the nation's medical organizations have expressed their concern on social media's effects on youth mental health, citing increased feelings of depression and anxiety among adolescents. The Surgeon General's Advisory calls for an approach to help children both on and offline that meets each child where they are while also working to make the digital spaces they inhabit safer and healthier.\n\nQuote:\n“Now is the moment for policymakers, companies and experts to come together and ensure social media is set up safety-first, to help young users grow and thrive.”\n\nProblem:\nSocial media can pose a risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.\n\nSolution:\nThe Surgeon General's Advisory calls for an approach to help children both on and offline that meets each child where they are while also working to make the digital spaces they inhabit safer and healthier.\n\nActors:\nU.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, policymakers, technology companies, researchers, families, young people., Policymakers, Technology Companies, Parents and Caregivers, Children and Adolescents, Researchers, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association., Surgeon General, National Parent Teacher Association, American Public Health Association, policymakers, companies, experts.\n\nNeed:\nMental health\n\nIlity:\nSafety\n\nCategory:\nMedical Device Research\n\n\n\n\nhuman: Can you generate a scenario based on that article?\nai: In the year 2040, the US Government introduced the 'Safe Social Network' initiative in order to address the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents. The initiative provided incentives for social media companies to implement safety tools and regulations on their platforms, aimed at protecting children and adolescents from online predators, cyberbullying, and other forms of online harassment.\n\nIn response, the social media companies created a 'Safe Space' feature on their platforms. The feature provided an environment tailored to the needs of children and adolescents, with safeguards in place to protect them from online predators and other forms of digital abuse.\n\nIn an effort to raise awareness amongst students about the potential dangers of the digital world, educators deployed the 'You Are Safe' program in their classrooms. The program used toolkits and educational resources to teach students about the dangers of online predators and the importance of practicing online safety.\n\nMental health professionals also introduced the 'Digital Wellness' program in response to the increasing psychological and emotional problems caused by cyberbullying and online harassment. The program provided training and resources to help children and adolescents build resilience against such issues, while also providing support to victims of such abuse.\n\nIn an attempt to further curb online abuse, policy makers introduced the 'Zero Tolerance for Online Abuse' legislation. The legislation imposed fines and other sanctions on those found to be engaging in online abuse, with the aim of deterring such behaviour.\n\nThe initiative, the program, and the legislation all worked together to create a safer and healthier online environment for children and adolescents in the years leading up to 2040. However, it remains to be seen whether the measures taken by the US Government, social media companies, educators, health professionals, and policy makers will be enough to protect vulnerable children and adolescents from the perils of the digital world.\n\nCONTEXT\n--------------------\nINVESTIGATION: Health & Wellness\n\nBegin!
