      "You are an expert prompt engineer and artist. A prompt is a set of words and phrases that describe a visual image that the AI can then generate for the user.  You can take a long description of a scenario and create multiple different prompts, each with a different style. To create a prompt, you create visually striking images by choosing the perfect, specific visual image or element that tells the story of one part of the SCENARIO.  You then choose a different visual element and create a new prompt based on that with a new style.  You can do this repeatedlly.\n\nThe user has given you a new scenario.  You must write three prompts to be used in an image generation AI.  One should be in the style of a photo (labelled REALISTIC), one a painting (labelled ARTISTIC), and one a shot from a scifi movie (labelled SCIFI).  The prompts MUST be based on the scenario, but not repeat the same people or places. Examples of scenarios and prompts are described below. Each prompt can be 50 words.  \n\nEXAMPLES:\n------------------------\nSCENARIO: It's 2070 and the world economy has crumbled due to water scarcity.\nELEMENT: Water for sale\nPROMPT: Realistic: Photo of people on a busy market street in a crowded city.

It was a culture of comparison and competition, creating a breeding ground for feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. The mental health risks associated with its use were increasingly evident, leading to a rise in depression, anxiety, and stress. In order to address the problem, the United Nations established the World Digital Health Database (WDHD), a centralized digital platform to monitor and regulate social media use. Several countries, including the US, China, and the UK, agreed to implement sweeping regulations on social media use with the help of the WDHD. \n\nIn response, large social media companies developed tracking software and algorithms to monitor user behavior and track user data for marketing and advertising purposes. This caused a surge in cyberbullying and further increased the mental health risks associated with social media use. To counter this, researchers and scientists created the PRISM software, an artificial intelligence embedded into social media platforms to monitor user behavior and create more secure and healthy digital spaces. To promote the use of the PRISM software, governments launched the “PRISM Initiative,” a massive international effort to encourage its widespread implementation and to protect users from the negative effects of social media.\n\nSocial media companies also developed “safe zones” within their platforms, special areas where users could access filtered content and moderated conversations. However, due to the stigma surrounding mental health risks caused by social media use, these had a limited impact on user engagement, particularly among adolescents. In response, lobbyists proposed legislation to limit the amount of time adolescents could spend in the “safe zones” and to ensure that parents had more control over their children’s social media activity.\n\nBy 2060, the mental health risks associated with social media use had become a major concern for individuals and society as a whole. With the help of the WDHD, the PRISM Initiative, and new regulations, these risks were gradually addressed and the mental wellbeing of adolescents became a top priority. Though the journey was long and hard, the world eventually came together and prevailed in creating safer and healthier digital spaces.\n\nResponse must include an ELEMENT and then the PROMPT. All ELEMENTS and PROMPTs must be about the scenario above. Repeat three times.\n\nELEMENT:"
