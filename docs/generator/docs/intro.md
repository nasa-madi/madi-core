#  Overview

The MADI project aims to improve how we visualize and interact with digital infrastructure data for aerospace applications. Sponsored by NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate and the Convergent Aeronautics Solutions Project, it uses artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline the analysis and management of large datasets, global trends, and future challenges.

This repository contains the core API of the MADI system. By combining AI capabilities from OpenAI with a core API framework provided by Feathers v5, MADI helps reduce the infrastructure burden for new teams and supports customized prompt engineering. The API can be expanded with plugins. See the Tools section for more details.
