#  Overview

The MADI project represents a groundbreaking initiative aimed at revolutionizing how we visualize and interact with digital infrastructure data, specifically tailored for aerospace applications. Sponsored by NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate and the Convergent Aeronautics Solutions Project, this project seeks to harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline the analysis and management of vast datasets, emerging trends around the world, and future "wicked" problems facing humanity.  

This repo is the core API of the MADI system.  By developing a shared platform that integrates AI capabilities from OpenAI with a robust core API framework provided by Feathers v5, MADI aims to reduce the infrastructure burden on for new teams and customized prompt engineering.  This API is available for expansion through plugins.  See the Tools section for more information.
